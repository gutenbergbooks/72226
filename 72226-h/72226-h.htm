<small>THE CAVE OF WHISPERS</small></h2>

<hr class="tiny">

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>DR. BELDEN’S ESTABLISHMENT</small></h3>
</div>

<p>The establishment of Dr. James Belden was pleasantly
situated upon the southern shore of Long
Island, some ninety odd miles from the city. The
spacious house was fitted with every modern convenience
and comfort, and stood in extensive, well-wooded
private grounds. There were good fishing and boating
to be had and the white, well-kept Long Island
roads afforded excellent facilities alike for riding
and driving.</p>

<p>The establishment was in reality a cross between a
sanatorium and a physical culture resort. The doctor-proprietor
carefully examined each person upon
arrival and kept his directing eye upon him during
his stay. He prescribed the diet and the exercise
suited to each case and saw to it personally that his
instructions were carried out. Many a wreck of the
city’s storm and stress had the Doctor sent back to the
metropolis renovated and renewed, and many were
the haggard devotees of late hours and city dissipation
who had returned, after a sojourn at the retreat,
with vigor in their limbs and the hue of health in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
their cheeks. In a word, the Doctor was a philanthropist,
at a hundred a week, who extended a haven
of rest for human wrecks and turned them out again
on the high seas of life staunchly refitted to renew
the struggle. The Doctor himself, in fact, often referred
to his establishment as a haven of refuge,
which nautical expression was, perhaps, not inapt,
inasmuch as the harbor in question was not infrequently
visited, in popular parlance, by “swells”
and “high-rollers.”</p>

<p>Dr. Belden himself was an exceedingly genial person,
who well knew how to keep his various guests
amused and in good humor with themselves and the
world in general. The one subject which disturbed
the Doctor’s equanimity was the presence in the neighborhood
of a recently established private asylum for
the insane maintained by a Dr. Weldon. The similarity
between the names Weldon and Belden had led
upon certain occasions to various distressing and distinctly
embarrassing mistakes. Thus, when distinguished
visitors had at times mentioned that they
were staying at Dr. Belden’s establishment, rustics
of the neighboring villages had been known to tap
their heads significantly and adopt either attitudes
of alarm, or patronizing airs, as the case might be.
While little Reggie Smithers had been sojourning
at Dr. Belden’s the rumor had been circulated at
his club that he was incarcerated in an asylum for
lunatics and a friendly wag had written him a letter
of condolence, in which he took occasion to remark
parenthetically that he had always entertained an
innate conviction that Reggie would eventually so
wind up, at which Reggie had been exceedingly
wroth and had felt impelled to cut short his stay and
return as quickly as possible to the city, so as to give
the lie to the rumor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The early summer of nineteen hundred found the
sanatorium fairly well filled with guests, not the
least notable among whom was Mr. Thomas Kearns,
the widely-famed head of New York’s Secret Service
Bureau, who had selected this quiet retreat at
which to build up his magnificent muscular development
and repair the ravages upon his general system
incurred by his exciting and somewhat irregular
mode of life in the city. To describe Mr. Kearns
as widely famed was certainly not overstating the
case, for he was conceded to be the ablest detector
of crime in the country. So many were the great
mysteries which he had unraveled and with so many
important cases had he been connected that his fame
had stretched far and wide, extending beyond the
confines of the United States and reaching into foreign
lands. In a word, his reputation was international
and his achievements had been lauded in
many countries and in many tongues.</p>

<p>His fellow-townsmen of the great metropolis—in
fact, his countrymen at large—were proud of
Thomas Kearns. When Americans traveling
abroad heard of some mystery which the secret police
of European capitals were unable to solve, they were
wont to smile in a superior way and exclaim:
“They ought to send for Kearns over here—our
Kearns. He would show them what’s what!”</p>

<p>Everybody from the doorman at Police Headquarters
to the Police Commissioners and the heads of
the city government treated Mr. Kearns with distinguished
consideration; he was regarded as one
of the Institutions of the city. No one ever dreamed
of interfering with Mr. Kearns. And well he justified
this trust. Under his administration the
criminal classes were kept in a subjection and awe
which rendered life and property more secure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
New York than in any other great city of the world.
No criminal from other cities dared seek abode in
the metropolis without first reporting to Mr. Kearns
as to his advent, his place of domicile, the causes of
his visit, and the duration of his stay, and no man
of criminal record might, under any circumstances,
by day or by night, venture to put foot south of
Fulton Street, into the great financial centres where
the heaped-up wealth of the city was stored.</p>

<p>Possessed of ample means, no breath of suspicion
had ever touched Mr. Kearns. The vicissitudes
of his calling had enabled him upon many
occasions to be of inestimable service to various financial
powers, and these powers had gladly placed at
his disposal information which had enabled him
to build up a handsome private fortune. He was
a man of some forty years, of medium height and
well-rounded figure, with blue eyes, a ruddy complexion
and the general appearance of a prosperous
merchant; but the blue eyes had a very keen look at
times and the lips a peculiar way of pursing themselves
under the heavy, well-kept brown moustache.</p>

<p>It is true that here and there at times it was whispered
about that Mr. Kearns’ success was largely
due to the vast army of informers—“stool pigeons,”
as they were technically termed—fostered
and maintained by him among the criminals themselves,
and that in many of his most famous cases
the mystery had been solved by confessions procured
through the exercise of the mysterious rites of the
“third degree.” The precise nature of these rites
was known to none save the initiated, but it was
darkly hinted that, in certain subterranean cells
beneath Mr. Kearns’ official quarters, tortures were
practised beside which the horrors of the Spanish
Inquisition paled into insignificance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>As to the truth of these rumors there seemed to
be no precise means of ascertaining, but certain it
was that Mr. Kearns’ methods were eminently successful
and—nothing pays like success!</p>

<p>With that easy geniality which was one of his
characteristics, within twenty-four hours after his
arrival Mr. Kearns was on terms of friendly
acquaintance with the various other guests. Most
of these were men about town, of various ages, but
all suffering from much the same physical troubles,
and all possessed of much the same manners,
habits and train of thoughts. Of men of this
stamp, Mr. Kearns saw enough in the city and
they did not particularly interest him. Among
these guests, the one who most attracted his interest
and attention was Professor Walter Stuart Dean, of
Chicago. Professor Dean until recently had filled
the chair of Science at Chicago University, but had
been forced out because of a book on political
economy he had published. Some of the theories
set forth in this work were of so advanced and radical
a character as to give offense to certain patrons
of the Institution. Professor Dean’s views were
held to be nothing short of an assault upon the sacred
Rights of Property. As one obese and influential
patron of the seat of learning put it, “Capital stood
aghast” at Professor Dean’s views. As someone
must suffer whenever poor, timid Capital is thrown
into a fright, Professor Dean, in spite of his conceded
great abilities, was made to pay the penalty.</p>

<p>The Professor, however, accepted the situation
with much equanimity. He had succeeded in selling
to one of the great cable companies an invention
in connection with the transmission of messages and
had received quite a goodly sum. This placed him
in a position of pecuniary ease so far as the immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
future was concerned, and he had come to Dr.
Belden’s establishment to recruit his energies in
preparation for the launching of a scientific scheme,
very comprehensive and ambitious in its scope, dealing
with the question of aërial navigation.</p>

<p>The Professor was a man of some forty-seven
years, tall and thin and with that slight stoop of the
shoulders peculiar to the student. The face was
clean-shaven and pale, with a marked puff of the
flesh above each eye where the brows were wont to
contract in the intensity of thought. When the firm,
well-cut features lighted in a smile, the face became
positively handsome. One of the Professor’s hobbies,
which he was fond of discussing with Mr.
Kearns, was the question of the economic condition
of the masses of the people. The Professor contended—and
it pained his kindly nature that such
was the case—that the great mass of the people were
not as well-off as they should be; that the true happiness
and well-being of the great body of mankind
had not advanced in proportion to the world’s progress
in other directions.</p>

<p>Another pet subject of discussion with the Professor
was his theories of aërial navigation. In
fact, he declared that he had fully and satisfactorily
solved the problem and was prepared in the near
future to produce a craft with which the air could
be navigated at will, both in safety and at high speed.
His plans for this work, he explained, were fully
perfected and the completed invention would have
been an accomplished fact some time before had he
not been hampered by lack of means. But with the
funds received from the sale of his electrical device
to the cable company he was in possession of sufficient
means to put through the work properly, and
he intended to devote himself actively to this matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
as soon as his present vacation was over. In the
meantime, he had written on the subject of aërial
navigation sundry pamphlets which had attracted
attention in scientific circles.</p>

<p>At first, Mr. Kearns was disposed to regard Professor
Dean’s projects in this connection as partaking
of the visionary, but as he grew to know him
better, the Professor’s clear-headedness and conservatism
made more and more of an impression
upon him and he came to regard aërial navigation,
with Professor Dean as its introducer, as not such
an unlikely possibility in the near future.</p>

<p>Another acquaintance made by Mr. Kearns was
that of Dr. Raoul Jaquet. Dr. Jaquet was not a
guest of Dr. Belden’s famous establishment, but
lived in a cottage of his own some little distance
away. He was on friendly terms with Dr. Belden,
who spoke of him as a man of remarkable attainments
in certain branches of scientific research,
notably in chemistry and toxicology. Dr. Jaquet
cultivated friendly relations with Professor Dean
and Mr. Kearns, and his visits to Dr. Belden’s establishment
became more frequent than ever. All three
were fond of exercise on foot and they took long
rambles together over the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Dr. Jaquet, too, had, like Professor Dean, his
hobby, and this hobby was the subject of suspended
animation. He was a Frenchman some fifty years
of age, short and spare of figure, with a complexion
dark as if stained with walnut juice, and very black
and very curly hair, lightly streaked with gray. He
spoke with great volubility, in quick, jerky little
sentences whose peculiar idiomatic twists suggested
a direct translation from his native French. Upon
one occasion, they visited his cottage and he showed
them different animals, apparently sound asleep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
which he declared were in various stages of suspended
animation. He pointed out a peacefully sleeping
dog, and explained that it had been in this condition
for sixty-five days without a particle of food or drop
of liquid. He also exhibited a rabbit which had been
in the same state for four months. All he had to do,
the Doctor declared, was to restore them to wakefulness
and they would promptly resume their normal
condition. Mr. Kearns failed to restrain a mild
expression of his skepticism; but the Doctor’s voluble
protestations forced him to accept the statement of
their condition, though he still maintained the animals
could either not be aroused at all, or else
would drop dead as soon as awakened. The Doctor
promptly awakened the rabbit. The animal seemed
at first slightly lethargic and dazed, but it quickly
vindicated the Doctor’s claims by cavorting about its
cage and then falling to work, in a businesslike way,
upon a proffered lettuce leaf.</p>

<p>Doctor Jaquet was enthusiastic on the subject of
hibernation, pointing with pride to the achievements
in this direction of snakes and many animals, which
were known to live to great ages. He declared his
conviction that in suspended animation could be found
an excellent cure for many diseases, notably troubles
of the digestive tract; that during the period of suspension
Nature, freed from the necessity of performing
her ordinary routine functions, would be given
an opportunity of making her own cure. In a word,
suspended animation was, according to Dr. Jaquet,
the great and true panacea for most of the evils with
which mortality was afflicted.</p>

<p>“You mean,” questioned Mr. Kearns, after Dr.
Jaquet had launched out into his favorite discussion
as a sequel to the resurrection of the rabbit, “if a
man has trouble with his liver, or a pain in his stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
instead of giving him a pill, or other dose, you
would suspend him?”</p>

<p>“That which you say there has reason!” replied
the Doctor in his peculiar phraseology.</p>

<p>But Mr. Kearns’ manner indicated his skepticism
and the Doctor seemed quite piqued.</p>

<p>“And how do you bring about this condition of
suspended animation?” asked Mr. Kearns.</p>

<p>“I put them to sleep. I can make sleep any person—all
the world!” declared the little Doctor with
conviction.</p>

<p>Mr. Kearns smiled.</p>

<p>“Ah! You doubt it?” asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Could you put me to sleep, for instance?” inquired
Mr. Kearns, parrying the question.</p>

<p>“With facility!” replied Dr. Jaquet.</p>

<p>A look of polite incredulity crept into Mr. Kearns’
face.</p>

<p>“Will you that I shall try?” asked the Doctor
eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Kearns remained silent, somewhat taken aback
by the novelty of the situation.</p>

<p>“Ah, you hesitate! You have fear that I shall
succeed. But have no fear. There is nothing which
can do you hurt. On the contrary, only good!”</p>

<p>“Fear!” exclaimed Mr. Kearns with a start.
“Do not, I beg you, form the idea that I am afraid
to subject myself to your test. I must return to Dr.
Belden’s early, so I cannot avail myself of your offer
to-day, but extend it again some time and, upon my
word, I shall be much inclined to take you up.”</p>

<p>“I can make you sleep for six hours, six days, six
weeks!” declared the Doctor with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Let us call it six hours and I should consider that
you have fully vindicated your assertion,” replied
Mr. Kearns with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Very well. I will prove to you some day,” declared
Dr. Jaquet. “Now, listen! To-morrow I
will call for you at one o’clock. We will take a great
walk together. I will conduct you to a little piece
of land which I own over there in the mountains.
On this land is a cave, where I will show you some
wonderful things.”</p>

<p>“Very well; that sounds interesting,” replied Mr.
Kearns. “You will call for us to-morrow, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my friends; au revoir until to-morrow,”
said the Doctor genially, as he courteously bowed
them to the door.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” asked Mr. Kearns
of Professor Dean, as they walked down the road on
their way back to Dr. Belden’s.</p>

<p>“Of what?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Of the assertions made by our interesting little
French friend,” replied Mr. Kearns.</p>

<p>“In what connection?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to this suspended animation business and
his ability to put people to sleep and so on.”</p>

<p>“My work has been entirely confined to the practical
branches of science,” answered the Professor cautiously.
“I have really never had any opportunity
of investigating any matters of this nature. Many
peculiar claims and theories have been advanced as
to mesmerism, hypnotism, and auto-suggestion, but
I am not really competent to advise you as to their
merits.”</p>

<p>“Answered with the caution of an expert on the
witness stand!” cried Mr. Kearns with a laugh.
“But tell me this! Do you believe that out of ten
men picked haphazard, he could succeed in getting
say two out of the ten into a condition of suspended
animation, or hypnotic sleep, or whatever you like
to call it? What puzzles me is his apparent ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
to do it with those animals. If it were not for that
fact, I should not be inclined to give the matter much
attention.”</p>

<p>“I really could not express an opinion,” declared
the Professor.</p>

<p>“Then, answer me this, O Mountain of Caution!”
cried Mr. Kearns. “Would you be willing to join
with me in putting the Doctor to the test?”</p>

<p>The Professor remained thoughtfully silent for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Kearns maliciously, “shall
I throw the taunt in your teeth, which the little Doctor
threw into mine: that you are afraid?”</p>

<p>“I will answer you this way,” replied the Professor
calmly. “To-morrow you and I are going out
together in company of the Doctor. Should you decide
at any time to-morrow while we are together to
enter upon an adventure of this character, you will
not find me loth to join you. When people start out
together in any enterprise, it is a maxim with me
that they should stand shoulder to shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a brick!” declared Mr. Kearns with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Professor dryly; “it is a conceded
fact that bricks do not talk. You are really
becoming more wonderful than the Doctor in your
assertions!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>“SLEEP ON, MY FRIENDS, SLEEP ON”</small></h3>
</div>

<p>At the time appointed on the following day—it
was the tenth of June, 1900—Dr. Jaquet called for
them and they started on one of their customary
walks. The Doctor acted as guide. His course lay
inland, in a northwesterly direction, and the trio
marched jauntily on, chatting gaily together, until
some four miles had been covered. Then the Doctor
changed his course and they struck across country
through land which was somewhat rocky and broken
and thickly covered with scrub bushes and trees of a
stunted growth.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” exclaimed Mr. Kearns, “this is pretty
rough walking. Remember, too, we have the return
journey. What is the use of wearing ourselves
out going over ground like this?”</p>

<p>“Follow me,” urged Dr. Jaquet, who was leading
and picking the way with care.</p>

<p>“Well, tell us at least where you are leading us,”
said Mr. Kearns. “It’s wild enough here never
to have been trodden upon by the foot of man.”</p>

<p>Thus questioned, the Doctor explained that he was
leading the way to a little tract of land which he
owned in the midst of this wilderness of scrub growth,
apparently abandoned entirely to the squirrels and
the jack-rabbits. He told how he had one day explored
this land and had, by the sheerest accident, discovered
a natural cave possessing some wonderful
peculiarities. He decided to buy the land upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
which it was located, and had acquired it for a mere
song as it was practically valueless for any purpose
whatsoever. He had kept the cave a secret for fear
of its being visited by intruders. They, too, must
promise him to keep the matter secret. Patience!
The ground was rough, but they would soon be there.</p>

<p>“Rough!” exclaimed the Professor; “it’s as
rough as civilization.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come,” responded Kearns, “you’re always
criticising civilization.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s a success?” demanded the Professor.</p>

<p>“Do you dispute it?” challenged Kearns.</p>

<p>“Can it, after all, be said,” answered Professor
Dean, thoughtfully, “that mankind at large has
really gained any practical good by that progressive
evolution known as civilization? Suppose you were
the chief of a great tribe existing under primitive
conditions, and suppose that you, possessed of all
the knowledge of modern life which you have to-day,
were confronted with the proposition as to
whether you would leave the tribe as it was, or would
introduce all the conditions of our present advanced
civilization, what would be your decision?”</p>

<p>“Without having given the matter much thought,”
replied Mr. Kearns, “my offhand answer would be,
I suppose, that I should divest my primitives of
breech-clouts and put them into top-hats and trousers,
and supply them with churches, theatres, hospitals,
hotels, a stock-exchange, a police headquarters, and all
the other and usual adjuncts of civilization.”</p>

<p>“And if I were the chief of such tribe, and you
brought such proposition to me, I should hesitate long
before accepting it,” rejoined the Professor. “I
should ponder carefully whether it was not my
bounden duty to the tribe to decapitate you, lest you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
should escape and give the world knowledge of the
existence of me and my tribe and thus bring to us
by force the civilization which you proffered. What
would your civilization mean to the tribe? It would
give us great cities and the million and one artificial
adjuncts which form part and parcel of modern life.
Would the men of the tribe be as happy, as healthy,
or as really comfortable in the teeming tenements,
or box-like flat houses of the cities which had sprung
up, as they were under their tents upon the plains?
For those tenements and flat houses they would have
to pay rent, and to earn that rent they would be compelled
in many instances to convert themselves and
their families into industrial slaves. Who ever heard
of so-called savages being evicted for non-payment of
rent, or dying by the hundreds for want of food as a
consequence of economic conditions? And yet, let a
great city spring up and you have thousands of such
cases every year! You have spoken of the churches
which your civilization would erect, but for every
church which your great city of modern civilization
would bring into existence, it would also create ten,
nay one hundred, drinking-shops and gambling-houses
and brothels. And as to morality, is a primitive
community without churches ever as immoral as a
civilized community with a church to every other
block? You have spoken, too, of hospitals. It is
true, your civilization would bring fine hospitals, with
an army of doctors and vast stores of drugs, but with
these your civilization, with its artificial forms of life,
would bring into existence a thousand and one diseases
utterly unknown to men living in a primitive
state. Your cures might be very comprehensive and
marvelous, but surely it would be infinitely better
to escape the diseases themselves, in the first place.
With pardonable professional pride, you have also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
alluded to the existence of a police headquarters, but
under primitive conditions such a place would be
needless, for the causes which bring about the majority
of crimes in a civilized community would not
exist. In a word, the primitive tribesmen to whom
I have referred would be safe as to their liberty,
their homes, their health and their morality, whereas
under civilization, and in return for the artificial
and really superfluous adjuncts it has to offer, these
primitive people must become industrial slaves and
rent-sweaters and must surround themselves with all
the evils arising from corruption, crime, immorality
and disease. Who, I ask you, is the happier? The
tribesman procuring his means of livelihood at will
by fishing in rivers or in streams, or scouring the
woods and the plains in search of game, or the free-man
in name, but industrial slave in verity, who
under the beneficent sway of our modern civilization
ekes out a miserable subsistence in some sweatshop
of the city at a dollar and a half a day.”</p>

<p>“I must admit your tribesman would seem to have
the best of it,” declared Mr. Kearns.</p>

<p>“And look, too, at the social relations,” continued
the Professor. “In primitive life, the savage maiden
mates according to her fancy, according to the
promptings of her heart. In modern civilization, if
we are to judge from what we so often read and hear,
a great number of marriages turn upon the question
of position, or of money, rather than of true affection.
Winsome May, stung by her necessities or her ambition,
offers herself up to chill December, or, her
dainty flesh quivering with repulsion, surrenders herself
into the arms of hoary Midas, and the children
of such union are the offspring of Gluttony mated
with Disgust. You see, these are questions which
affect the very life blood of the nation! In this and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
a hundred other ways, the tide of social life is interfered
with and changed by the ever present influence
of that one controlling factor in civilized life—money,
money, money! Upon my word, it would
seem as if the primitive tribesman had much better,
in the interests of his true happiness and well-being,
remain as he is!”</p>

<p>“What you say as far as crime is concerned,” replied
Mr. Kearns, “is undoubtedly true enough. If
you except those offenses perpetrated under the influence
of sudden passion, the great majority of
crimes arise from the necessities and temptations
which form part of modern social life. A good deal
has been from time to time written about persons
with criminal tendencies. There are undoubtedly
such cases, but my experience is that a career of
crime involves more hazard, harder work and less
pay than almost any other form of occupation a man
could go in for. The average criminal would be
perfectly willing to undertake any amount of honest
work to accomplish his ends, if it were within his
power to accomplish them by such means, and he only
perpetrates his crime because he sees no other way out
of the situation. In saying this I am not justifying
his methods, or warranting the soundness of general
deductions, but am merely stating a fact. Crime is,
as a rule, the result of environment, and this environment
grows out of the conditions of modern social
life.”</p>

<p>“Then you admit the correctness of the facts upon
which my theory is based!” exclaimed the Professor.</p>

<p>“To a certain extent, yes,” replied Mr. Kearns;
“but what would you? Would you advocate the
renouncement of civilization forthwith and a return
to the primitive status?”</p>

<p>“In the existing state of affairs,” answered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Professor gravely, “we are confronting a condition,
not a theory. Of course, it would be utterly impracticable
to advocate such a course; but I do say
that we ought to be more modest in our vaunts as to
these benefits conferred by our boasted modern civilization
and that we ought to strive to make that civilization
give a larger share of well-being and happiness
to the great masses of men. As it is, civilization
means the accruing of immense advantages to the
few with corresponding very doubtful benefits to the
many. This is all wrong and will not be permitted
to continue forever.”</p>

<p>Thus chatting on, they forced their way over
ground which grew rougher and rougher and through
brushwood and undergrowth which seemed to become
more and more dense. Twice Mr. Kearns had severely
stubbed his toe against rocks and the Professor’s
nose had been lacerated by some particularly
vicious brambles. Both were becoming somewhat
tired and were wondering what manner of chase they
were being led, when the Doctor suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“<i>Voila!</i> Here we are!”</p>

<p>His body bent almost to earth, Dr. Jaquet squeezed
his way between two matted masses of undergrowth
and, his companions following, they found themselves
in a clearing, entirely surrounded by heavy bushes
and covered by a rocky formation of very peculiar
outline. From one side of the rock the Doctor removed
a quantity of heaped-up brush and disclosed
quite a large opening.</p>

<p>“My cave!” declared Dr. Jaquet proudly.
“Await me while I make light!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the Doctor struck a match and descended
into the cave. A moment later he reappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“I have lighted the lamp,” he said. “You may
enter.”</p>

<p>His companions now perceived some roughly made
steps which led down from the opening. These they
carefully descended and found themselves in a goodly-sized
cave of irregular formation—a cave which was
partly the work of nature, but which had evidently
been enlarged and partly transformed by human
hands. On the floor were a number of heavy rugs
and ranged along the walls were various furnishings.
In the centre, suspended from the roof, was a handsome
Venetian lamp, which now served to illuminate
the surroundings.</p>

<p>“Welcome!” exclaimed the Doctor in a loud
whisper.</p>

<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Instantly following the Doctor’s whisper, his utterance
was repeated three distinct times in different
parts of the cave. The effect was startling and
weird.</p>

<p>“This I call ‘The Cave of Whispers,’” said Dr.
Jaquet, in response to his companions’ inquiring
looks. “See! You whisper and your words they
come back to you!”</p>

<p>The Doctor then went on to explain that one of his
objects in buying the land and fitting up the cave was
to make a study of acoustics: a science comparatively
undeveloped to this day. But the place had a
peculiar charm for him apart from this, he declared.</p>

<p>The Professor and Mr. Kearns amused themselves
for some time whispering various sentences, all of
which were faithfully echoed back to them.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Dr. Jaquet, “you must be tired
my friends. You shall yourselves rest and I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
give you tobacco to smoke which you will find fit for
a Sultan.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he arranged for them some rugs and
cushions and produced a handsome Turkish Narghille,
which he placed before them on the floor. This he
proceeded to prime with a long-fibred, very pale-colored
tobacco, and to each of them he handed an amber
stem.</p>

<p>“Smoke, my friends, and enjoy you yourselves,”
he said, as he applied a light to the tobacco. “Ah,
it is, perhaps, a little chilly here. I will cover you
and you shall have the music, too.”</p>

<p>He stretched a rug over each of them, and then,
from the side of the cave, brought forth a little music
box, which he placed beside him and set in operation.</p>

<p>Dr. Jaquet took up a position facing them and
lighted a Turkish cigarette.</p>

<p>“You are quite comfortable, my friends?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Quite!” answered the Professor.</p>

<p>“Delightful!” came the reply from Mr. Kearns.</p>

<p>And the cave echoed back their words.</p>

<p>The tobacco was peculiarly soothing and delicious.
It really was, as the Doctor had declared, worthy of a
Sultan. Both the Doctor’s companions were somewhat
tired after their walk. A peculiar sense of
restfulness and comfort was upon them as they lay
at ease, smoking the very excellent tobacco and listening
to the sweet music falling so gently upon their
ears. Thus silently they lay and smoked on. The
Doctor’s usual volubility was checked and he quietly
smoked his cigarette, his black eyes fixed upon
them.</p>

<p>The music box reached the end of its melody.
Instantly the Doctor started it again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Look!” he said, in a low whisper, bending toward
them. “Look at the lamp! See how it throws
out to you all the light, all the fire of the diamond.”</p>

<p>Slowly and mechanically, in obedience to his direction,
they turned their eyes toward the gorgeous
hanging lamp. It was as the Doctor said. From
its glittering, multi-colored glass sides the light
seemed to refract in a thousand variegated shades.
The smoke issued from between the smokers’ lips in
slow and dreamy puffs; the rose-water bubbled
rhythmically in the pipe; the sweet music played on.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The odor of a strange incense seemed to fill the air.
The lamp, grown to giant dimensions, appeared to
send forth shafts of ever-changing light. The walls
of the cave rolled back, disclosing magnificent
cathedral aisles, boundless in expanse and rich in
marble and porphyry and gilt, through which the majestic
tones of an organ swelled. A sense of religious
fervor and of overmastering awe filled their souls.</p>

<p>The scene changed. They were amid the gorgeous
splendors of an Oriental palace—a palace which in
its vastness was lost to all sense of proportion and
whose massive dome reached high to heaven.</p>

<p>Hark! The strains of barbaric music, the clashing
of cymbals. A multitude of dancing girls spring,
fairy-like, into motion and move and sway in all
the graceful, voluptuous motions of the Oriental
dance. Their gazelle-like eyes sparkle; the ornaments
upon their bosoms flash—surely this is the
inner Paradise of Mohammed!</p>

<p>Again the scene changes. The great dome of the
Eastern palace parts in twain and they are slowly
and deliciously wafted upward. They have no sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of the strangeness of their situation—no fear. Upward,
ever upward, they pass to giddy heights and
yet this same sense of all-pervading contentment and
happiness. The air about them is laden with the
perfumes of Araby, and strains of melody of more
than earthly sweetness greet the enraptured senses.
This must be the music of the spheres—the chant
of the heavenly choir! And through this perfumed,
music-laden air they are drifting—drifting—drifting——</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The amber mouthpieces had dropped from the
smokers’ lips; their heads had sunk back upon the
cushions; their lids were closed.</p>

<p>Gently, cautiously, the Doctor rose, his black eyes
dilated with excitement. Over the sleepers he bent,
making mysterious passes toward them as they lay.
For an hour or more he thus worked; then with a
sigh of exhaustion, the perspiration starting from his
brow, he stepped back and contemplated them.</p>

<p>“Sleep on, my friends,” he exclaimed, with a
chuckle of satisfaction; “sleep on. Thus could I
let you sleep for weeks—many weeks—but, I take
it, the twenty-four hours will be enough to convince
you that the Doctor Jaquet can make all the world to
sleep.”</p>

<p>He replaced the Turkish pipe and the music box
in their respective places and put the other articles
in the cave in order. Then he procured more rugs
and arranging them over the sleepers, tucked them in
carefully.</p>

<p>“Au revoir, my friends, until we meet again,”
he murmured and, with a sweeping bow to the sleeping
forms, he made his exit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Once outside, he carefully replaced the quantity
of brush which effectually concealed the entrance to
the cave. As he did so, there was a heavy, rumbling
noise in the distance, and he glanced at the sky.</p>

<p>“I must get me home at high speed!” he muttered
to himself as he noted the darkening heavens.
“There is a storm which is coming.”</p>

<p>He accordingly retraced his steps at his best speed.
He had proceeded but little more than half the distance,
however, when the storm broke in all its fury:
vivid flashes of forked lightning alternating with
terrific clashes of thunder. Still he pressed on, not
knowing how long the storm might last and bent
upon reaching home.</p>

<p>At last, however, this Summer storm reached such
a pitch of violence that he found himself compelled
to seek shelter until its full fury had in some degree
been spent. Not a habitation in sight! Some distance
down the road, however, was a great oak, whose
wide-spreading branches would afford at least a temporary
haven. Hastening his steps, he reached the
tree.</p>

<p>At that very instant, the whole heavens were
illumined with a tremendous blaze of light. A great
zigzag tongue of forked lightning shot forth and
darted down upon the oak, rending its massive trunk
asunder in one awful stroke.</p>

<p>And at the foot of the shattered tree, as the thunder
crashed forth, lay a blackened and blighted shape,
horrible to behold—the body of Dr. Raoul Jaquet.</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>ON THE BROAD HIGHWAY</small></h3>
</div>

<p>A-a-a-h!</p>

<p>A prolonged sigh swelled from Dean’s lips.</p>

<p>“Thunder and Mars!” Kearns raised himself
languidly on his elbow.</p>

<p>It seemed to them both that they had been sleeping
for quite a long time—an unusually long time.</p>

<p>Where was the Doctor?</p>

<p>The sunlight was streaming down upon their faces.
They were no longer in the cave, but were lying in
the outer air upon the grass, their rugs still wrapped
about them. A few steps away were two men, apparently
laborers, who stood contemplating them with
looks of wonderment not unmingled with alarm.</p>

<p>Slowly and unsteadily, Kearns rose to his feet.
Dean followed his example. Both seemed weak and
dizzy.</p>

<p>Kearns turned a pair of blinking eyes toward the
laborers.</p>

<p>“How did we get here?” he asked with the husky
voice of a man with a bad cold.</p>

<p>One of the laborers pointed toward the cave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
About the entrance some felled trees and piled underbrush
showed where the men had been working.</p>

<p>“Where—where is the Doctor?” stammered
Kearns, his eyes still blinking in the strong sunlight
and his thoughts and words coming with some
effort.</p>

<p>The two laborers turned to each other. On the
face of each was a bucolic leer. They eyed each other
for an instant and then the taller of the two slowly
raised his forefinger, tapped his forehead, and winked
knowingly to his companion. He was a tall, loose-jointed
fellow, with a little black mark on the left
side of his nose and there was something impudent
and aggressive in him as he stood there grinning and
showing his yellow fangs. His companion was short
and stocky, with a freckled face, sandy hair, and a
manner suggestive of bashful awkwardness. He
turned to the two strangers furtively, as if half fearful
that the other’s actions might give offense.</p>

<p>“The Doctor,” repeated the taller man slowly
and with peculiar intonation; “the Doctor! I guess
the chances be he’s not far off and in a hot chase after
both of yees!”</p>

<p>And he chuckled softly to himself, glancing at his
companion.</p>

<p>“Not far off! Have you seen him? Which way
did he go?” quickly inquired Dean.</p>

<p>“Seen him?” repeated the rustic; “no! I ain’t
seen him, nor any of his men.”</p>

<p>“Then what made you say he was not far off?”
demanded Dean.</p>

<p>Silence from the two rustics, who continued to exchange
glances.</p>

<p>“Look here, my good men!” exclaimed Kearns
impatiently; “wake up and listen to me. Just show
us the way to the road and you shall be suitably rewarded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Perhaps, too, you would find us a horse and
carriage which we could hire to take us home.”</p>

<p>The two men stared at the speaker, open-mouthed,
amazed. Again they turned to each other.</p>

<p>“A horse and kerridge!” they exclaimed in a
breath.</p>

<p>Then they broke into a loud laugh. Now it was
the turn of Kearns and the Professor to exchange
glances of astonishment. That a simple request to
be supplied with information as to where a horse and
carriage could be hired should produce such results
was certainly amazing.</p>

<p>Kearns stepped nearer to Dean. “I believe these
fellows are crazy,” he whispered. “Perhaps they
have escaped from the Weldon Asylum.”</p>

<p>“The smaller man seems a case of senile dementia,”
whispered back the Professor, cautiously; “but
the larger fellow looks to me like a dangerous lunatic—possibly
a homicidal maniac. We may be in
danger of our lives!”</p>

<p>While this colloquy was in progress, the rustics
had not taken their eyes off the strangers for an instant.
The taller of the two again spoke up.</p>

<p>“A horse and kerridge,” he said. “Maybe if ye
had a pitchfork apiece ye could scoot away through
the air, leaving only a streak of brimstone behind ye.
I’ve heerd tell o’ sech things!”</p>

<p>Kearns’ quick temper flashed up. He advanced
upon the speaker.</p>

<p>“Confound you, you impudent——”</p>

<p>“Run fer it, Jem; run fer it!” yelled the smaller
man apprehensively. “They’re a-goin’ to spell!”
He took to his heels at full speed.</p>

<p>Jem gave one quick glance at Kearns and was off
after his companion.</p>

<p>Kearns and the Professor stood watching their rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
retreating figures until they disappeared around
the bend of a hill.</p>

<p>“Well—I’m hanged!” exclaimed Kearns.
“Mad,” he added with conviction, “mad as March
hares.”</p>

<p>“You see what comes of ill-advised asperity!”
remarked Dean reprovingly. “Instead of soothing
these two unfortunate madmen, you have thrown
them into a condition of excitement. Your impetuosity
has reacted upon them. You have sent them
flying—running amuck—and God knows what may
happen to any unfortunate who crosses their path!”</p>

<p>“But did you ever know of such impudence?”
cried Kearns, still angry. “I civilly ask these louts
the direction of the main road and where I can hire
a horse and carriage; they laugh in my face; invite
me to ride on a pitchfork! Things have come to a
pretty pass if every lunatic one meets thinks he has
full license to be as impudent as he pleases. And
they acted as if they thought we were crazy, confound
them!”</p>

<p>“It’s a common delusion of crazy folks to imagine
everyone is crazy except themselves,” said the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s very true! I’ve noticed that!” assented
Kearns.</p>

<p>“As I remarked before, a case of senile dementia,
that little fellow,” said the Professor sagaciously;
“a clear case of senile dementia, my good friend!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” declared Kearns, “I noted his sickly
smile.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dean, “they’re gone and we are
fortunately left alive to tell the story and to put
the madhouse people on their trail. The next thing
to be done is to find the main road and get to the
nearest village. There we can hire a conveyance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
and get refreshments. I am both hungry and
thirsty.”</p>

<p>“The nearest village,” repeated Kearns musingly;
“I take it that would be Averill, or would Patchley
be nearer?”</p>

<p>“I should say Averill, decidedly.”</p>

<p>“Well; let’s be off, then, and find the main road,”
suggested Kearns. “This must be the way, I’m
pretty sure.” Picking up the blankets and rugs in
which they had been wrapped, he tossed them through
the entrance to the cave and started off.</p>

<p>“Is it safe, do you think, for us to leave those
things there?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“What else can we do with them?” answered
Kearns. “Let the Doctor attend to that. We’ll
notify him, of course, as soon as we get back. He
had no business to leave us in that fashion, anyway!”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you as to that,” assented the
Professor. “Tired out with our walk, we must have
fallen asleep as we smoked and he calmly left us.”</p>

<p>“By George!” exclaimed Kearns, with a sudden
start; “I wonder if the Doctor has been up to any
of his pranks.”</p>

<p>“Pranks!” repeated the Professor in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes; putting people to sleep. I wonder if this
sleep of ours was of his contriving.”</p>

<p>The Professor contracted his brows thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Now that you mention it,” he declared, “I should
not be astonished if it was.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice that pale-colored, peculiar, but
certainly very excellent tobacco?” continued Kearns
eagerly. “Upon my word, I begin to suspect it was
fixed—doped—drugged!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say so!” exclaimed the Professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Well, I just did say so,” retorted Kearns.</p>

<p>“If such is indeed the case, how long do you
think we have slept?” questioned the Professor.</p>

<p>Kearns drew out his watch, looked at it and then
put it to his ear.</p>

<p>“What does your watch say?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Professor consulted his watch.</p>

<p>“It has stopped,” he declared. “Why, it seems
to be run down.”</p>

<p>Kearns glanced at the sky.</p>

<p>“Professor,” he remarked solemnly, “it looks to
me as if we had slept clean into the next day.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked the Professor, vacantly.</p>

<p>“Both our watches are run down,” replied Kearns.
“That’s one point. When we entered the cave it was
half past three o’clock in the afternoon. From the
sun I’d say it’s now about one o’clock. As time hasn’t
the habit of going backward, I’d reach the conclusion
that this must be the afternoon of the following
day.”</p>

<p>“Really, this is most astonishing!” exclaimed the
Professor, apparently quite shocked at the idea that
he should have thus slumbered for nearly twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>They worked their way around the base of a hill,
over ground rough and stony and partially covered
with trees and undergrowth. Before long they
emerged upon comparatively open ground and then
a puzzling feature presented itself to their attention.
When led to the cave by the Doctor, he had taken
them miles through scrub growth and over rough
land. Now, after traveling a comparatively short
distance they had emerged into the open and before
them stretched fields under cultivation, while some
three-quarters of a mile away lay a broad, white road.
This was decidedly a much shorter cut than the path<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the Doctor had taken. But how was it that he had
not known of it? It was really puzzling!</p>

<p>“There’s the road!” exclaimed Dean, pointing
to the broad, white line in the distance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Kearns, musingly, “but is that
the road we are looking for? This doesn’t seem
to be the way we came. The lay of the land is different.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we have come out of the brush in a
different direction,” suggested Dean.</p>

<p>“We certainly must have,” replied Kearns.
“Well, right or wrong, there’s nothing to do but to
make for that road before us.”</p>

<p>The wisdom of this view was apparent, and they
accordingly made their way around the fields under
cultivation and finally—hot and tired—gained the
road. Up and down it they looked and perceived
in the distance, some two miles away to the left, the
outlines of what appeared to be a goodly-sized town.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the name of that place may be,”
remarked Kearns.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, it’s a good way off,” replied Dean,
mopping the perspiration from his brow. “But
have you noticed what a magnificent road this is?
It reminds me of one of those splendid <i>chemins</i> of
Southern France, only this is even finer.”</p>

<p>Both stood admiringly contemplating the road. It
was very wide, very white and splendidly smooth.
On one side was a broad, raised pathway, evidently
for the use of foot-passengers. A curious feature
of the roadway itself was its division by a raised
earthwork barrier, cutting it into two even parallel
halves. At regular intervals were steps by which
ascent might be made from the road to the footway
and also little bridges connecting the dividing barrier
with the pathway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Quite a model road,” commented Kearns. “I
suppose it’s some kind of a speedway. It’s queer,
though, that I never heard there was such a road in
this section. Fact is, I don’t remember ever seeing
a road of this kind anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” declared Dean.</p>

<p>They were standing on the extreme edge of the
road, just where they had stepped out from the field.
A short distance away was a bend, concealing the
run of the road for some little distance beyond.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were two sharp toots, as of a horn,
a rattle and a rush of wheels, and past them dashed
a peculiar, arrow-shaped, horseless vehicle, traveling
at tremendous speed. So rapid was its flight that
they had time to catch only a fleeting glimpse of a
man, whose right hand gripped a long, shining lever.
So sudden was the appearance of the vehicle and so
great its speed that the two wayfarers were both
startled and astonished.</p>

<p>“Was that an automobile?” exclaimed Dean.</p>

<p>“It looked like one,” answered Kearns, “but I
never before saw one of that peculiar construction.
And the speed! Whew!”</p>

<p>“Yes; reckless to the last degree,” remarked Dean.
“I think it would be highly desirable for us to gain
the footpath before we meet another traveler.”</p>

<p>“Stated with the accuracy of science,” declared
Kearns. “By all means, let’s take the footpath.”</p>

<p>They accordingly traversed the first roadway, clambered
over the dividing barrier, crossed the second
roadway and ascended to the footpath. Then they
turned their faces in the direction of the town visible
in the distance. They had proceeded but a few steps
when Kearns suddenly stopped and turned to the
Professor with the air of a man to whom a happy
thought has come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Professor,” he said with a smile, “it’s just occurred
to me that right here, in my hind pocket, I’ve
a flask. I remember slipping it in before starting,
thinking it might come in handy during our walk,
and it looks now as if it might.”</p>

<p>“A flask!” exclaimed the Professor, diffidently.
“May I ask what it contains?”</p>

<p>“Whiskey—just plain whiskey,” replied Kearns,
as he pulled out the flask. “It’s a warm day and we’re
both tired, in spite of that long rest. May I invite
you to join me?”</p>

<p>“The day <i>is</i> warm,” assented the Professor, “and
we <i>are</i> tired. I do not usually indulge, but upon this
occasion——”</p>

<p>“Help yourself,” exclaimed Kearns, detaching the
small silver receptacle which served as a drinking
cup and handing it and the flask to Dean.</p>

<p>The latter helped himself and handed back the
flask to Kearns. “Really!” he exclaimed with some
show of alarm, “that seems to be powerful stuff. I
can feel it all through me.”</p>

<p>“It’s the finest old Kentucky whiskey,” replied
Kearns, somewhat nettled that the quality of his liquor
should be questioned. “It was a special present
to me from Colonel Claybourne, the famous
distiller.”</p>

<p>“Powerful—very powerful!” repeated Dean.</p>

<p>Kearns poured himself out a liberal measure.</p>

<p>“Ah! Splendid stuff!” he exclaimed as he lowered
the drinking cup from his lips. “That puts
new life into one. But, by George, you’re right! It
is strong. I never before found it so strong as this.”</p>

<p>“It must be because we are drinking it upon empty
stomachs,” suggested the Professor.</p>

<p>“Even so,” declared Kearns, “I can’t understand
why it should seem to have such strength.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>They proceeded on their way and had gone but a
short distance when they came to a huge sign-board,
planted high up upon the barrier dividing the two
roadways. This sign-board bore a number of lines,
in great black letters. The two wayfarers stopped
and eagerly scanned the inscription. It read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Any violation of these Regulations will be <span class="allsmcap">PROSECUTED</span>
to the <span class="smcap">Full Extent of the Law</span>.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padright">WARING,</span><br>
I. &amp; R. Commissioner of Highways.</p>
</div>

<p>They read the sign over and both stood staring at
it, a puzzled expression on their faces.</p>

<p>“Very curious!” commented Dean. “The language
used seems to me quite strange. Take that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
word <i>voiter</i>, for instance. What does it mean? Did
you ever see the word before?”</p>

<p>“Never!” declared Kearns, still staring at the
sign-board.</p>

<p>“It is, I take it,” continued Dean, “a new-fangled
word coined by the makers of automobiles to designate
some new kind of motor conveyance. Possibly
it is taken from the French word <i>voiture</i>, which
means carriage.”</p>

<p>“What’s puzzling me,” said Kearns, “is the title
of this fellow Waring, who signs that notice. Read
it: ‘I. &amp; R. Commissioner of Highways.’ It’s
high-sounding enough, but what the deuce does the
‘I. &amp; R.’ stand for?”</p>

<p>“‘I. &amp; R.,’” repeated the Professor, staring hard
at the sign. “I find it impossible to imagine what
those letters stand for. If we were in Europe, I
should instantly surmise the meaning, but we are in
the United States.”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’re in the United States,” replied Kearns,
“and here we see those letters only around election
time—‘<i>I</i>’ for Independent and ‘<i>R</i>’ for Republican.
But that wouldn’t explain matters here; for
what’s the meaning of the ‘<i>and</i>’ between the two
letters? Well, I don’t suppose we’ll find out by
standing here in the sun staring at that big board.
Besides, I don’t care a rap whether this Waring is
a Republican or a confounded Independent. Let’s
have another little nip from the flask to recruit our
strength and move on.”</p>

<p>“I seldom indulge,” began the Professor, “but——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be bashful, Professor,” hastily interposed
Kearns; “help yourself.”</p>

<p>After each had thus refreshed himself, they renewed
their journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“From your scornful reference to Independents
just now,” remarked Dean, “you don’t seem to hold
them in very high estimation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, those Independents!” exclaimed Kearns,
with fine scorn. “It’s my experience that an Independent
is usually a fellow with a keen eye to <i>his</i>
independent interest. His independence consists of
balancing his vote between the two parties, with a
view to casting it for the side offering him the higher
inducement. A pest on your Independents, I say!
But, hello! what’s the matter with your hat?”</p>

<p>The sun was streaming fiercely down and the Professor,
to shield his face, gave the brim of his white
Fedora a sharp pull over his eyes. But the brim
parted from the crown and settled comically around
his nose. An examination of the hat showed the
goods to be in a condition which Kearns described
as “absolutely rotten”—almost brittle as tinder.</p>

<p>“A nice hat that!” commented Kearns. “Permit
me to ask you the classic question: Where did
you get that hat?”</p>

<p>“At Knox,” ruefully answered the Professor.
“But,” he added, critically surveying his companion,
“it doesn’t seem to me that you have much to boast
about as a Beau Brummell.”</p>

<p>It was Kearns’ turn to examine his clothes.
Glancing down at the blue serge suit he wore, he saw
that a large section of cloth had apparently rotted
away from the bottom of one of the trouser legs,
and the lining of the coat had broken away from the
material in several places. Like the Professor’s hat,
the whole material seemed tinder-like and brittle.
To add to his discomfiture, the leather of his left
shoe began to part company with the sole. Ruefully,
Kearns noted this involuntary disrobement.
He had always been somewhat particular in dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Professor,” he exclaimed humorously, “if we
want to keep our reputation for decency it’s high time
we reached home.”</p>

<p>“Very high time,” assented Dean solemnly.</p>

<p>“If we could only get a hack, or a conveyance of
any kind,” lamented Kearns.</p>

<p>“I would be willing to ride home in the bottom
of an express wagon,” declared the Professor.
“Even a coal cart I would not despise.”</p>

<p>“But there’s not a vehicle in sight!” deplored
Kearns.</p>

<p>“Not even an ash-cart, or a hearse,” declared the
Professor.</p>

<p>“There’s just one more nip left in the flask,” said
Kearns, sadly; “let’s take that and move on.”</p>

<p>“I rarely indulge,” began the Professor, “but——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know!” interrupted Kearns hastily;
“you’ve mentioned that before. Kindly help yourself.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Professor, sternly, “I was going
to add that I felt it my duty to do so upon this
occasion out of regard for you.”</p>

<p>“Regard for me!” exclaimed Kearns in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the Professor. “For some time
past I have noticed, sir, that the tip of your nose is
becoming unduly red, and that your eyes have the
congested appearance which betokens incipient intoxication.
I do not know, sir, whether in due regard
for you—who, from the position you hold, are
presumed to pose as a conservator of public morals—it
is not my duty to forthwith dispose of that little
which yet remains in this pernicious flask.”</p>

<p>“Professor,” declared Kearns, mockingly, “out
of consideration for you, I have hesitated to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
earlier, but it now is incumbent upon me to say that
I have had my eye on you for more than ten minutes
past. You, as an instructor of the community and a
trainer of budding youth, should stand forth as a
firm and shining example of all that is straightforward
and goodly, and yet it is my duty to inform
you that your present way is not straightforward nor
is your walk upright. In a word, you are staggering,
Professor.”</p>

<p>“Sir!” exclaimed the Professor with dignity.</p>

<p>“A fact, sir!” declared Kearns. “I will draw a
mark upon this path and I’ll wager two to one
you can’t walk it in a straight line.”</p>

<p>“I can’t accept your test,” said the Professor cautiously.
“I’m somewhat fatigued to-day and I admit
a certain peculiar weakness in the knees.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” exclaimed Kearns.</p>

<p>“Shall we divide?” asked the Professor softly,
holding the flask in his hand.</p>

<p>“Agreed!” whispered back Kearns.</p>

<p>Once more they started, speculating as they went
over what strange necromancy the Doctor could have
exerted to work such curious effects alike upon their
surroundings and their persons. When about a mile
from the village they saw approaching two women,
carrying between them a basket.</p>

<p>“Good-day, Ma’am,” said Kearns with much politeness,
as they met; “it’s a warm day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the elder woman, “it is a
warm day, but seasonable for this time of year.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Kearns, “you don’t usually have it
as warm as this out here so early in the year, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Early in the year!” exclaimed the woman.
“Sure it’s not too warm for the end of July.”</p>

<p><i>The end of July!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Kearns and the Professor turned to each other in
bewilderment. It was the tenth day of June when
they had started on the walk with Dr. Jaquet, and
here was this woman telling them it was the end of
July. Oh, monstrous, incredible! They had slept
a full six weeks!</p>

<p>“Then, too, sir,” continued the woman, who
seemed not disinclined to rest her heavy basket and
indulge in a little gossip, “it’s always apt to be warm
on a hot day around fourteen o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Around fourteen o’clock!” repeated Kearns and
the Professor, both agape.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I consider fifteen o’clock to be the hottest
hour of the day.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen o’clock!” echoed the men.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Kearns, after a pause, “what’s
the name of that village?”</p>

<p>“Pemberton, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pemberton—Pemberton,” repeated Kearns.
“I thought I knew all the places in this section, yet
I never heard of Pemberton. Can you tell me in
which direction lies Averill?”</p>

<p>“Averill, sir? I never heard the name.”</p>

<p>“Have you lived here long?”</p>

<p>“All my life.”</p>

<p>Kearns paused a moment thoughtfully. Then a
sudden thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>“You say this is the end of July?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir; the twenty-fifth.”</p>

<p>“Any news lately about the nominations?”</p>

<p>“Nominations, sir!” repeated the woman; “what
nominations?”</p>

<p>“Why, the Presidential, of course!”</p>

<p>“The Presidential,” repeated the woman blankly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Kearns, gently; “the Presidential
nominations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>The woman made no reply; she stood staring
blankly at the speaker.</p>

<p>The younger woman all this time had been eyeing
the wayfarers with curiosity. Into her brown eyes
there now came a look of suspicion and mistrust.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she whispered, plucking the elder woman
by the sleeve, “we’d better be going.” And
she caught up one end of the basket.</p>

<p>The situation was certainly embarrassing.
Kearns made a hasty endeavor to turn the subject.</p>

<p>“The village seems a good way off and we are
tired,” he said. “Do you think, if we wait here,
we might get a horse and carriage to take us to the
village?”</p>

<p>The woman glanced sharply at him and gathered
up her end of the basket. She and her daughter
started on their way. As she passed Kearns, she
turned her head.</p>

<p>“It’s ill work,” she said, “a-poking fun at those
who’ve given you naught but civil answers.”</p>

<p>Kearns and Dean stood watching the retreating
figures as they passed down the road. Suddenly, as
by one impulse, they faced each other. The Professor
laid his hand upon Kearns’ shoulder.</p>

<p>“The twenty-fifth of July—did you hear that
woman say——”</p>

<p>“Yes; I heard,” answered Kearns, slowly.</p>

<p>“If her statement be true, we have been dead to
the world for a good six weeks.”</p>

<p>Both men stood silent for a moment. Then the
Professor again spoke:</p>

<p>“These strange surroundings—the queer actions
of these people! What can it all mean?”</p>

<p>“Mean!” answered Kearns with a laugh. “It
begins to look as if we were either mad, or bewitched!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE MAN WITH THE COCKED HAT</small></h3>
</div>

<p>For a long minute they stood there, facing each
other, undecided and perplexed, bewildered by the
strangeness of the situation. Kearns spoke first.</p>

<p>“The end of our trouble lies there,” he exclaimed,
pointing to the village. “I’m hungry, thirsty and
tired. Come!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” answered the Professor. “Let
us push on, by all means.”</p>

<p>In spite of heat and fatigue another half-hour
found them on the outskirts of the village. As they
approached they were passed several times by vehicles
leaving the village and proceeding along the road at
a high rate of speed. The occupants of most of these
vehicles scanned the wayfarers with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>Reaching the village, the first thing to attract their
attention was the peculiar construction of its streets.
The sidewalks on either side of what appeared to be
the principal street were moving sidewalks and the
roadway, where the vehicles passed up and down,
was depressed to a depth some twenty feet below the
level of the sidewalks. At all the street crossings
were bridges connecting the sidewalks on either side
of the way.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blessed!” exclaimed Kearns. “I had
no idea there was such a town as this in these parts,
or anywhere else, for that matter!”</p>

<p>“It certainly seems to be a model place,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the Professor. “Just look, what a splendid system
of separating the vehicles from pedestrians.”</p>

<p>“If such a system could be adopted in the city,
it would annually save many lives now lost in street
accidents,” remarked Kearns.</p>

<p>The second house before them was a comfortable
inn, with a low, wide porch, holding a number of
tables where sat men drinking.</p>

<p>“I am really very thirsty,” said the Professor.
“Let us refresh ourselves here before going further.
Shall we take a table on the porch?”</p>

<p>“No,” suggested Kearns, “let’s go inside. We’ll
probably get quicker service.”</p>

<p>They ascended the two steps, crossed the porch and
entered what appeared to be the bar-room. It was
spacious, with tables and chairs on either side of the
entrance and with a long bar facing the door. Behind
the bar stood a white-jacketed bartender.</p>

<p>“What will you have?” inquired Kearns, as they
reached the bar.</p>

<p>“A long drink of Rhine wine and seltzer,” answered
the Professor.</p>

<p>Kearns turned to the bartender.</p>

<p>“A long drink of Rhine wine and seltzer and a
high ball.”</p>

<p>“A long drink of Rhine wine and seltzer and a——?”</p>

<p>“High ball.”</p>

<p>“High ball? Never heard of it,” the bartender
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Kearns. “Never heard of
a high ball? It’s the most popular drink in the
country.”</p>

<p>“That’s likely, isn’t it?” answered the bartender,
with some scorn. “I’ve worked in a good many
places in New York and I never heard of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Never heard of it!” cried Kearns. “Why,
man, the head barkeeper of the Waldorf-Astoria told
me a couple of weeks—that is—ah—a couple of
months ago—that they sold over two hundred high
balls a day.”</p>

<p>“The Waldorf-Astoria,” repeated the bartender,
shortly; “what’s that?”</p>

<p>Kearns could only gasp in astonishment.</p>

<p>“The Waldorf-Astoria,” repeated the bartender
meditatively; “oh, yes! I think I remember now.
Isn’t that the big restorang and commercial lodging-house
’way down below Forty-second Street somewhere?
Sure, I remember, now. I couldn’t tell you
what they may sell in a place like that. I’ve always
worked in first-class places. How did you say that
drink is made?”</p>

<p>“Simply a little whiskey and a long dash of seltzer,”
said Kearns, wearily.</p>

<p>“Oh!” answered the bartender airily; “that’s a
Marquanna—called after the famous Marquis Marquanna.”</p>

<p>“Call it what you like,” said Kearns testily, “but
serve it up; I’m parched with thirst. Give me Hunter
whiskey.”</p>

<p>“What whiskey?”</p>

<p>“Hunter.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of it!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Kearns. “What have you,
then?”</p>

<p>“What brands? Why, we have both.”</p>

<p>“Both? How do you call them?”</p>

<p>“Imperial Court and Consolidated Trust.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of either of them,” retorted Kearns,
maliciously. “However, give me either one; only
hurry.”</p>

<p>The bartender produced a long-necked bottle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Rhine wine and a peculiar wicker-covered bottle of
seltzer. The whiskey he measured out and poured
into a tall glass. Then he added the seltzer.</p>

<p>Both the wayfarers emptied their glasses in one
long, greedy draught.</p>

<p>“That really went down well!” remarked the
Professor as he laid aside his glass.</p>

<p>“So well,” replied Kearns, “that I think we
might venture once again. What say you, Professor?”</p>

<p>“I rarely—” began the Professor.</p>

<p>“Fill them up again,” ordered Kearns of the bartender.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a commotion at the
other end of the bar-room which attracted general
attention. Ranged against the wall were three
strange looking machines, remotely suggestive of barber
chairs. There was a man seated in each of two
of the machines, which, with a gentle whirr of wheels,
were in operation. They were automatic shaving
machines, operated by depositing a coin in the slot.</p>

<p>The commotion which had been caused grew out of
the fact that one of the machines had apparently become
disordered, which resulted in the occupant of
its chair receiving a slight gash upon one side of
his chin. The person thus mutilated was furious.
He sprang from the chair and, seizing his walking
stick, began furiously belaboring the machine.</p>

<p>“The Chinese pest seize (whack! whack!) this
confounded, infernal machine (whack! whack!) it’s
gone and cut me nearly clean through to the teeth
(whack! whack! whack!) I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Hi! Hold on there!” yelled the man in the
adjoining machine. “You’re shaking this automat
of mine, sir, so that it’s trembling all over; just at
the moment, too, when the knife’s over my gullet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“I don’t care!” howled back the man with the
stick. “I’ve been cut and I’ll never stop until I’ve
smashed this infernal thing into bits.” And he
banged away at the machine.</p>

<p>“Stop, I say!” yelled the other man, with bulging
eyes, “I can feel the knife entering my skin.
If I’m cut, I’m liable to get the erysipelas. By heaven,
sir, if you make this automat cut me, I’ll have
your blood!”</p>

<p>The bartender, scenting a tragedy, ran from behind
the bar and succeeded finally in pacifying the
man with the stick.</p>

<p>“It isn’t often those machines get out of order,”
said the bartender as he returned to his post, “but
when they do, it’s apt to make customers mad.”</p>

<p>“They are automatic shaving machines, I see,”
remarked Kearns.</p>

<p>“Yes; and a mighty handy and ingenious invention
they are,” answered the bartender. “You drop
a dime in the slot and you get a light or close shave,
as you may desire, and your photograph thrown in
at the end of the operation. Did you ever try
them?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you ought to,” urged the bartender.</p>

<p>“Never!” said Kearns with decision. “I find
it bad enough to have my nose tweaked and my face
bedaubed by a human, but never will I trust my life
to any confounded machine of this character. By the
way, you may serve up those drinks I ordered.”</p>

<p>“Same?” inquired the bartender.</p>

<p>“Yes; that was pretty good whiskey,” said Kearns.
“What did you say was the brand?”</p>

<p>“Imperial Court.”</p>

<p>“And the other brand you have?”</p>

<p>“Consolidated Trust.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Well,” exclaimed Kearns, “I must say I don’t
like your names. I am equally opposed to Imperialism
and to Trusts. Between the two evils,
I don’t know which to choose. However, as I have
tried the Imperial brand, this time I’ll go in for the
Trust.”</p>

<p>The bartender gave the speaker a quick, sharp
glance. Then he winked warningly and rolled his
eyes in the direction of one of the tables at which two
men were seated. These two men were intently
watching Kearns and his companion, and as the former
turned, following the direction of the bartender’s
glance, both men hastily looked away and assumed
an air of listless indifference. One of the men was
small, with a blond mustache, blue eyes and a squint.
His companion was tall, thin and dark. In the meantime,
the bartender was preparing the drinks ordered.</p>

<p>He served these and, their first thirst somewhat
appeased, the travelers this time put down the glasses
only half emptied. Kearns laid a fifty-cent piece on
the counter in payment. The bartender picked it
up and eyed it curiously. Then he laid it carefully
away, not in the cash drawer, but among some small
glasses on one of the shelves of the bar.</p>

<p>“Let us have some cigars,” suggested the Professor.</p>

<p>“Good idea!” exclaimed Kearns, turning to the
bartender; “cigars, if you please.”</p>

<p>His voice was pitched somewhat higher than usual
and his face was slightly flushed. It was as if the
two drinks he had taken had gone a bit to his head.
Curious that a six weeks’ abstinence should make
a man so susceptible!</p>

<p>“What kind of a town is this, anyway,” said he
to the barkeeper, in a tone of banter, “where you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
don’t keep any of the popular brands of whiskey and
where I don’t see a campaign banner, though the
election is coming!”</p>

<p>“Election!” repeated the barkeeper blankly.</p>

<p>“Election is what I said,” repeated Kearns with
emphasis. “Which way does this town go—Democratic
or Republican?”</p>

<p>The bartender stared first at the speaker and then
turned an uneasy eye toward the two men at the
table.</p>

<p>“We are loyal here—loyal!” he stammered at
last.</p>

<p>“Loyal!” cried Kearns, flushing, “loyal to what?
The existing administration, I suppose you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes; to the—to the—existing administration,”
stammered the barkeeper confusedly.</p>

<p>At this point Dean interposed, with some show of
warmth.</p>

<p>“Then,” he cried, “I feel sorry for your intelligence,
for there was never a bigger nest of corruptionists
and oppressors of the people than the existing
administration!”</p>

<p>As these words were uttered there was a murmur
and a strange commotion in the place. The man
with the squint left the table and quickly passed out.
His companion rose and placed himself at the door,
as if to check any attempt at exit. The bartender
turned pale as one of his clouts behind the bar.</p>

<p>“Hush,” he whispered, apprehensively; “hush!
You will get yourselves into trouble and the house
will lose its license.”</p>

<p>“A pretty state of things,” retorted the Professor,
“when a free American citizen cannot speak his mind
openly. I say it, and I don’t care who hears me,
that I am opposed to Corruption, Imperialism and
Trusts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“GO!” cried the barkeeper, with the air of a man
wrought by his fears to a pitch of rage. “Out you
go, I say! You can’t talk that way in here!”</p>

<p>“All right!” interposed Kearns, apparently much
amused at the warmth displayed; “this gentleman
has told you his views and we’ll now take our cigars,
and go.”</p>

<p>“No! no!” cried the bartender, hastily removing
the cigar boxes; “go now—quick!”</p>

<p>But at this instant there was a sound of feet at the
entrance and the little man with the squint reappeared,
accompanied by a gorgeous creature in uniform
and cocked hat. The two stepped up to Kearns
and the Professor, while the dark man still maintained
his position at the door.</p>

<p>“Come!” said the man in uniform curtly.</p>

<p>“Why—what do you mean?” exclaimed Kearns.</p>

<p>“You are under arrest—both!” said the man
with the squint.</p>

<p>“Arrest!” exclaimed the Professor excitedly.</p>

<p>“Arrest!” cried Kearns angrily. “Why, what
the devil do you mean, sir? I am Thomas Kearns,
of New York, and I’ll make it precious hot for you
if you attempt any pleasantries with me!”</p>

<p>The little man regarded the speaker with an evil
and contemptuous leer.</p>

<p>“I don’t care who you be,” he said. “I arrest
you both.”</p>

<p>“For what?” interposed the Professor.</p>

<p>“Sedition,” said the little man.</p>

<p>“Sedition!” cried Kearns, with a guffaw; “sedition,
eh? And by what authority, pray?”</p>

<p>The squint in the man’s eyes became more pronounced.
He made a signal to his companion at the
door. The man in uniform laid his hand upon the
Professor’s arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“By what authority?” again demanded Kearns.</p>

<p>The man threw back his coat and displayed a resplendent
badge. Then came the answer to Kearns’
question:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">In the name of the King!</span>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A STRANGE REVELATION</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“In the name of the King!” cried Kearns, half
indignantly, half amused. “I’m sure I don’t understand
what you’re driving at; but from that badge
I take it you represent the Law, and the Law I am
always willing to obey. I’ll go with you; but I warn
you, you’ll suffer for this work!”</p>

<p>The two men made no reply to this threat, but
placing themselves on either side of him they marched
out of the place, followed by the man in uniform,
with Dean in charge. As they passed along the
street, several loiterers and a number of small boys
followed in their wake. The prisoners seemed to
arouse the greatest curiosity.</p>

<p>Their captors hurried them along at a rapid gait to
a neat stone building, with two imposing green lamps
outside. Up a short flight of stone steps the prisoners
were hustled and into a spacious room, where
behind a large desk sat a man in uniform. Before
the desk the party lined up.</p>

<p>“Is this the Sergeant?” asked Kearns, surveying
curiously the official uniform.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant,” curtly answered the man behind the
desk. “What’s the charge?” he asked sharply, turning
to the little man with the squint.</p>

<p>“Treasonable and seditious utterances in a public
place, Lieutenant,” answered the little man glibly.
“Utterances in violation of the statute and against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the peace of His Majesty, the King, his crown and
dignity.”</p>

<p>“Did you take exact note of these utterances?”
asked the official.</p>

<p>“I did, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Give them.”</p>

<p>In obedience to the command, the man gave a
fairly faithful repetition of the words uttered by the
Professor in the bar-room.</p>

<p>He who was addressed as Lieutenant looked serious.</p>

<p>“Your name,” he demanded of Kearns.</p>

<p>“Thomas Kearns,” was the answer, impressively
given; “and I’m chief of detectives of the New York
police.”</p>

<p>The Lieutenant glanced up quickly, with an astonished
look.</p>

<p>“My name isn’t unfamiliar, perhaps,” continued
Mr. Kearns with some sarcasm.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “the name is familiar to me.
So is that of Captain Kidd, and other legendary
heroes of the past. Thomas Kearns, eh? There
isn’t a small boy in the country who doesn’t know the
name and who hasn’t read of his exploits.”</p>

<p>For a moment Kearns stood silent, as if he hardly
gathered the sense of the words. Then his face
flushed and he found voice.</p>

<p>“You talk about the past,” he said, in incisive
tones. “I don’t understand you. I am the Chief
of the Department I have named—right now—at this
present moment; and that fact, I think, you’ll not
find disputed by any member of the Uniformed
Force, be his rank what it may. If you have any
doubt, I would suggest that you telephone to Official
Headquarters in New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Telephone!” ejaculated the Lieutenant. Again
he laughed amusedly.</p>

<p>“I said telephone,” retorted Kearns sharply.
“Perhaps,” he added scornfully, “you are not
equipped with such an instrument here!”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” answered the Lieutenant with a sniff,
casting his eye toward a handsome looking instrument
at the further end of the room. “A telephone, eh?
Yes, I remember some time ago seeing one displayed
as a curiosity at the Eden Musee in New York.
Quite an interesting antique!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Kearns sternly; “I haven’t time to
bandy foolish words with you. My friend and I are
tired and we wish to go home at once. I want to ask
you what kind of a charge this is upon which your
men have dared to arrest two reputable citizens.”</p>

<p>“Unless the Medical Examiner declares them irresponsible,”
answered the Lieutenant sarcastically,
“the two reputable citizens are likely to find this matter
pretty serious before they get through with it.”</p>

<p>“This is outrageous!” exclaimed Kearns, his anger
rising. “Your behavior, sir, is infamous. If you
occupied a similar position in the city to that which
you do here, I would have you brought up on charges
and reduced to the ranks for such conduct.”</p>

<p>The Lieutenant paid no heed to this outbreak.</p>

<p>“Your residence?” he demanded in formal tones.</p>

<p>Before Kearns could reply, the door of the station-house
was thrown hurriedly open and a tall, portly
man, with red face, iron gray hair and side whiskers,
bustled in. The Lieutenant turned his eyes toward
the new-comer and then raised his hand in military
salute.</p>

<p>“Are these the prisoners?” asked the arrival, walking
over to the desk.</p>

<p>“Yes, Colonel,” answered the Lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“They were found on my estate?”</p>

<p>“No, Colonel; they were arrested at Tomlinson’s.”</p>

<p>“I understand; but they were originally found on
my lands.”</p>

<p>“That I know nothing about, Colonel. I——”</p>

<p>“What do they say—what have you found out
about them?” interrupted the Colonel eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nothing as yet. I was about to take the record
when you came in.”</p>

<p>“I will question them myself,” said the Colonel.
He turned to the prisoners. His manner betrayed a
certain curiosity and eagerness, but his tone was
kindly and gentle.</p>

<p>“How did you come to be where you were found?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“The confounded Doctor!” blurted out Kearns
impatiently.</p>

<p>“The Doctor, eh!” exclaimed the Colonel with interest.
“What doctor? Tell me about him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Kearns, hesitating, “the circumstances
are somewhat peculiar and I don’t know
that either my friend or myself care to figure as the
heroes of a sensational newspaper story.”</p>

<p>“I beg you,” said the Colonel with great earnestness,
“to speak out at once. I believe it to be important—extremely
important that you should do so.”</p>

<p>Kearns still hesitated.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell the gentleman the state of the case, by all
means,” exclaimed the Professor. “I feel really
quite tired and exhausted and am anxious to get as
quickly as possible out of this dilemma.”</p>

<p>“Tired—exhausted!” cried the Colonel. He
turned to the Lieutenant. “Give them chairs. If
what I suspect be true, it is of the highest importance
that no mishap should occur to them!”</p>

<p>Chairs were procured for the two prisoners and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
when they were seated, Dean turned to his companion.
“Speak out and end this situation,” he again urged.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Kearns. Without further
delay he narrated their experiences with the Doctor
in the cave. The Colonel listened with extraordinary
interest.</p>

<p>“And so,” said Kearns in conclusion, “if this is
really the month of July, as I’ve been told, we must
have slept, or been in a condition of suspended animation,
as that confounded Doctor called it, for a period
of six weeks. But, tell me, what is the date?”</p>

<p>But the Colonel, who was looking at the prisoners
with absorbed interest, did not answer. Instead, he
put the following question, bending forward in eager
anxiety for the reply:</p>

<p>“Can you tell me the date when you went into that
cave and entered into that—ah—sleep you have described?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Kearns. “It was June
the tenth.”</p>

<p>“June the tenth of what year?”</p>

<p>“June the tenth, nineteen hundred, of course.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Whew!”</p>

<p>Both the Colonel and the Lieutenant uttered exclamations.
The Colonel was red and excited; the Lieutenant
half rose from his seat behind the desk. The
prisoners stared in astonishment. What could there
be so very extraordinary in the simple statement they
had made?</p>

<p>There was a dead pause for a moment. Then the
Colonel again turned to the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>“This is certainly very strange—very wonderful,”
he said. “They must be taken in hand pending developments.
Care must be taken of them—that they
do not succumb——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“What is so strange—what is it that is so wonderful?”
broke in the Professor.</p>

<p>But the Colonel disregarded the question.</p>

<p>“I will take them with me—to my place,” he continued,
addressing the Lieutenant. “They will be
properly cared for there.”</p>

<p>“But the charge! How about the charge which
has been preferred against them?”</p>

<p>“As a county magistrate, I am empowered to admit
them to bail.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, Colonel.”</p>

<p>“Let the charge stand. For the time being, I permit
them to go on their own recognizance. I will
take care of them.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Colonel. Will you please sign the
necessary papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes; give them to me.”</p>

<p>The Lieutenant handed the Colonel a paper and a
pen and the latter hastily scratched a signature.
Then he turned to Kearns and the Professor.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” he said.</p>

<p>But Kearns demurred.</p>

<p>“Will you excuse me, Colonel,” he said; “but
both my friend and myself want to go without further
delay to our own place. We’ve not the advantage of
your acquaintance, and I’m sure I don’t understand
the meaning of these proceedings.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been arrested on a serious charge,” said
the Colonel gravely, but with good humor, “and
you’re practically parolled in my custody. I don’t
see what you can very well do, except take advantage
of my hospitality, or adopt the unpleasant alternative
of a cell.”</p>

<p>“But,” began Kearns with indignation, “I must
assure you that——”</p>

<p>“I beg you not to excite yourselves,” exclaimed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Colonel, as one might seek to quiet a fractious child.
“It might be very bad for you—even fatal, under the
circumstances. No one can tell what might happen,
I assure you! Be content to come with me.”</p>

<p>“Let us go with the gentleman,” urged the Professor.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” answered Kearns. “I have no
objection to seeing the adventure through to the end.”</p>

<p>“Come, Bowman, come, Walker,” said the Colonel,
turning to the cross-eyed man and his companion;
“assist them to my phaeromobile.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we need assistance, thank you,” said
the Professor, rising and waving away the tall dark
man.</p>

<p>“Assistance, indeed!” exclaimed Kearns as he repulsed
the cross-eyed man. “I should say not!”</p>

<p>“But you might fall! Pray be careful!” urged
the Colonel with officious kindness.</p>

<p>“I may if I don’t get something to eat pretty soon,”
laughed Kearns.</p>

<p>“Yes; it is certainly high time we ate,” declared
the Professor.</p>

<p>“Ah, just as I feared!” remarked the Colonel
anxiously.</p>

<p>By this time they had passed through the door of
the station-house. Outside stood one of those curious
looking machines which Kearns and the Professor
had seen rushing past them on the highway. On the
front seat sat a man, apparently the driver. Behind
him, in the body of the vehicle, were seats for four
persons.</p>

<p>“Step in,” said the Colonel cheerily. Turning to
the cross-eyed man and his companion, he added warningly:</p>

<p>“Keep your mouths closed as to this matter. Not
a word for the present!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The two men thus addressed clicked their heels
together and saluted.</p>

<p>“Home,” said the Colonel to the driver, stepping
into the vehicle, “but not too fast!”</p>

<p>The driver saluted, turned a lever and they were
off.</p>

<p>“And now for a few words of explanation,” said
Kearns to the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Not a word, my good friends,” said the Colonel
with soothing patronage, “until you are thoroughly
restored—invigorated—out of danger!”</p>

<p>“Out of danger?” exclaimed Kearns mystified.</p>

<p>“What may be your meaning, sir?” inquired the
Professor.</p>

<p>Both stared at him as if he were a good-natured
lunatic.</p>

<p>“After six weeks of fasting,” said the Colonel diplomatically,
“a man should be willing to go quietly
to a meal, I think.”</p>

<p>They had passed beyond the limits of the town and,
having reached the highway, were flying along at a
rapid rate. Such was their speed that Kearns and
the Professor were not loth to hold their tongues and
attend to the matter of breathing. Along the road
they flew, finally turning down a side road and drawing
up in front of an ornamented iron gate, opened
to them by a lodge keeper; then down a winding
path, bordered by trees, until they stopped before the
steps of a stately house. The Colonel stepped out of
the vehicle.</p>

<p>“Welcome to Idleslip!” he said as he politely assisted
them to alight.</p>

<p>He led the way up the steps, across a spacious foyer
and turned into one of the rooms to the left. Drawing
up two comfortable armchairs, he motioned them
to be seated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Do you feel very weak?” he inquired with anxious
concern. “Shall I order you some refreshment,
or don’t you think it would be better to wait for the
doctor?”</p>

<p>“Doctor!” cried Kearns. “I thank you. I have
had all the doctor I want for some time to come.”</p>

<p>“Doctor!” exclaimed the Professor, who regarded
the question in a different light. “Let us cease playing
at cross-purposes. May I ask you frankly, sir,
why you think we need a physician?”</p>

<p>“Pray calm yourselves,” urged the Colonel soothingly,
“or, as I have already warned you, no one can
foresee the results! See a doctor? Why not!
After your remarkable—I may say, indeed, very extraordinary
experiences——”</p>

<p>“You refer to our sleep in the cave?” interposed
the Professor. “By the way, is it really possible that
we have slept six weeks? What is the date?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” protested the Colonel. “Don’t seek
any explanation now. Wait until later.”</p>

<p>“But this delay is exasperating,” persisted the
Professor. “All these strange happenings—this
mystery—play upon my nerves! I must insist upon
an immediate explanation. I must ask you, Colonel—Colonel—pardon
me, but what is the name?”</p>

<p>“I am Colonel, Sir Maynard Cuming.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sir</i> Maynard Cuming!” repeated Kearns mystified.</p>

<p>“<i>Sir</i> Maynard Cuming!” exclaimed the Professor,
passing his hand over his eyes. “Let me ask you—is
this the Republic of the United States, or have we
in our sleep, or trance, been spirited into some foreign
land?”</p>

<p>“The Republic of the United States?” said the
Colonel with a curious smile; “Well—no!”</p>

<p>Kearns and the Professor rose to their feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Kearns’ eyes were dilated, his hands clenched. The
Professor was very pale.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he said. “What country is this and—the
date—what?”</p>

<p>“Be calm,” urged the Colonel. “It’s not well you
should be told these things now. Wait until later!”</p>

<p>The Professor advanced a step and spoke with all
the concentrated energy of a thoroughly aroused man.</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth now,” he said, “or I’ll leave
at once and seek it elsewhere.”</p>

<p>The Colonel realized the situation had reached a
climax. Something must be done.</p>

<p>“Since you will have it so,” he replied gravely,
“I will answer you. Prepare yourselves to hear
calmly, bravely.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” cried Kearns breathlessly.</p>

<p>“You are at present,” answered the Colonel,
speaking very slowly and distinctly, “upon my estate
at Idleslip, seven miles from the county seat of Pemberton.
You are in the Empire of the United States,
within the realm of His Majesty, Imperial and Royal,
William the First, Emperor of the United States,
King of the Empire State of New York!”</p>

<p>His two auditors were staring at him wide-eyed,
speechless. It was difficult to decide whether they
took in the full sense of his words.</p>

<p>“The date,” continued the Colonel with enforced
calm, “is July the twenty-fifth, nineteen hundred
and seventy-five. You say you entered the cave June
tenth, nineteen hundred. If your statement is correct,
you have been in a state of suspended animation
for seventy-five years!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>SEARCHING THE FILES</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Seventy-five years!</p>

<p>For a moment both men stood breathless, stupefied.
A groan was stifled upon Kearns’ lips and he leaned
heavily upon the table for support. The Professor
stared blankly at the speaker, then put both hands to
his face and dropped back in his chair.</p>

<p>Was this some grim and ghastly joke; some hideous
vagary of delirium, or the night?</p>

<p>Alas, no!</p>

<p>The events through which they had passed; the unfamiliar
scenes encountered; the appurtenances of
the very room in which they sat; the manner of the
Colonel—all proclaimed the absence of illusion and
confirmed the existence of stern reality.</p>

<p>Seventy-five years!</p>

<p>Truly, only a brief span in the cycle of time, in the
relentlessly automatic passage of the ages, but how
much in the individual life of man. Seventy-five
years ago—who inhabited the house, the spot, in
which we live? What was our particular ancestor
doing; what was he like; what were his thoughts,
ideas, aspirations, hopes, ambitions, this day just seventy-five
years ago? How many hustling, bustling,
hoping, fearing, aspiring men and women who have
since passed away and of whom to-day there is not a
human being who knows that they ever were on earth.
And—seventy-five years hence! Who will then occupy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the house, the spot where we to-day live? Who
then, as the days sweep by, will ever give a passing
thought to us, or perchance even remember we ever
existed?</p>

<p>So, then, three-quarters of a century had passed
and with the passage of time surroundings and conditions
had also changed! And these two fortunate, or
unfortunate, derelicts of the past—what of them?
They were as relics of a bygone age; a species of
human flotsam and jetsam cast up upon a foreign
shore.</p>

<p>A sort of homesickness, a deadly nostalgia, was
upon them. Instinctively they turned to each other
for sympathy.</p>

<p>Kearns, with his stronger vitality and naturally
high spirits, was the quicker to recover from the
shock. He glanced down at his strong, knotted arm
and wrist resting on the table. Even if he had been
dead to the world for all these years, even if he was
over a century old, his muscles were as strong as ever
and the flow of life within him apparently unimpaired.
And if a man’s nerves have the courage and
his heart beats strong and full as at thirty, what matter
how many years have passed over his head!
Such was the thought which surged through Kearns’
mind. “A woman is as old as she looks, a man is as
old as he feels,” was the inconsequent and frivolous
idea which kept jangling through his brain. How
strange it is that in the most critical moments of our
lives, the incongruous and the odd will persist in obtruding
themselves upon our mental perception.</p>

<p>From the chaos of emotion the announcement had
developed in Kearns, curiosity began to grow. He
roused himself and turned to question the Colonel.
But the latter proved obdurate.</p>

<p>“Not another word will I tell you,” he declared;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
“not another word until medical advice is at hand.
You can understand the loss to the world and to science
should anything happen to you at this stage.
I’ve sent for the doctor. He’ll be here shortly.”</p>

<p>As the Colonel spoke there came a rap on the door
and the servant announced the arrival of the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Show him in at once,” ordered the Colonel. An
instant later a very brisk little man, with red cheeks,
black moustache and side whiskers, entered the room.</p>

<p>“Doctor Robinson O’Hanlenne,” announced the
Colonel, who proceeded to explain briefly the circumstances
to the new arrival. From the Colonel’s narrative
it appeared that two of his workmen had been
felling trees and laying out certain ground in a distant
and hitherto unused portion of his estate.
While thus engaged they had found the cave with the
two inanimate forms carefully wrapped in rugs lying
within. The Colonel told graphically the terror of
the men as the supposed corpses revived, and their
flight when a horse and carriage were demanded by
Kearns.</p>

<p>“A horse and carriage!” exclaimed the Doctor,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Precisely; a horse and carriage!”</p>

<p>And both laughed.</p>

<p>“The two men,” continued the Colonel, “ran to
the foreman. Fortunately I happened to be with
him. At the men’s story I hurried to the cave. The
peculiar and elaborate appointments of it astonished
me. In a little side recess I found some curious
notes and papers bearing on the subject of mesmeric
forces and suspension of animation. From the
ground I picked up a piece of money. It bore the
date eighteen hundred and seventy-six. ‘Come,’
said I to myself, ‘this piece of money must have been
coined at the time of the Presidency of the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
soldier, General Grant. Such money is surely not in
general circulation now!’ All of these strange occurrences
began to give me a faint hint of the truth.
Such cases are not entirely unknown to our modern
science, I believe, although the duration of the sleep
in this instance exceeds anything yet reported.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” commented Dr. O’Hanlenne.</p>

<p>“I started on a hunt for my involuntary guests,”
continued the Colonel, with a smile at Kearns and the
Professor. “On the Pemberton road I luckily encountered
Mrs. Merriweather and her daughter, who
had met two men who asked after strange places.
These men had actually made inquiries for a horse
and carriage.”</p>

<p>Both the Colonel and the Doctor broke into a guffaw.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” interjected the Professor. “I remember
the old woman—a queer sort of person who
talked about fourteen and fifteen o’clock and had
never heard of a Presidential election.”</p>

<p>Again the Colonel and the Doctor laughed.</p>

<p>“So you thought her language queer, did you?”
exclaimed the Colonel. “Fourteen and fifteen
o’clock sound strangely to your ears? Well; since
your day we have changed the nomenclature of time
somewhat and I think I may say without vanity we
have improved upon your methods. Instead of your
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> and <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, which we moderns find awkward and
cumbersome and likely to lead to confusion in certain
instances, we divide the day and night into a straight
twenty-four hours. Thus we count from midnight
to midnight. One hour after noon is with us thirteen
o’clock and the day closes at the last stroke of midnight,
which we name twenty-four o’clock. Thus it
would appear that old Mrs. Merriweather was not so
much out of the way, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Oh, I see,” replied the Professor, “but may I inquire
how it was that she had never heard of the village
of Averill and why so much anger on her part,
and merriment on yours, over our very innocent inquiry
for a conveyance?”</p>

<p>“What kind of a conveyance was it you asked
for?” inquired the Colonel, with a merry twinkle in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“A horse and carriage, sir,” answered the Professor
with dignity.</p>

<p>The Doctor coughed a discreet professional cough
and pressed his handkerchief to his lips in an all too
evident attempt to conceal his merriment. The
Colonel laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Averill,” said he, “as I happen to know from
certain old documents I have had occasion to examine,
was an old-time village long ago absorbed by the
town of Pemberton. Its very name has disappeared
from local memory. I am not astonished that Mrs.
Merriweather could not recall it. As for your demand
for a horse and carriage—why, my dear sir, it
is many, many years since horses were used. With
charging stations in every direction and our systems
of drawing electricity from the clouds, no man could
afford to deal with so slow, expensive and antiquated
an object as a horse. They are still used for the purposes
of racing and His Majesty, the King, on certain
state occasions sits in the royal chariot drawn by four
horses, but for all ordinary uses the horse has entirely
disappeared. You might as well have called for a
sedan chair.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the Professor blankly. “I suppose
I should have asked for a <i>voiter</i>. What, by the way,
<i>is</i> a <i>voiter</i>?”</p>

<p>“Simply a modernized name for vehicle,” replied
the Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Do you happen to have a public official named
Waring?” asked Kearns.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Colonel. “He is the Imperial
and Royal Commissioner of Highways, and
the best man for the post we have ever had! How
did you come to know of him?”</p>

<p>“I saw him stuck up on the sign-board,” said
Kearns absently.</p>

<p>“Stuck up on the sign-board!” exclaimed the Colonel,
somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes; his name was signed to the notice to travelers,”
explained Kearns.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Kearns regretfully, “I’m rather
sorry to learn about the retirement of the horses. I
was always very fond of them.”</p>

<p>“You will find a good phaeromobile much more
effective,” answered the Colonel with a smile.
“But,” he continued turning to the Doctor, “I must
continue my story. I followed our two friends along
their course and the trail they had left was a pretty
broad one. I finally traced them to the station-house.”</p>

<p>“The station-house!” exclaimed the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Colonel; “there on a charge
of seditious utterances—in the position of conspirators
against the peace and dignity of His Majesty,
the King.”</p>

<p>The Doctor laughed.</p>

<p>“I rescued them from their perilous situation,”
continued the Colonel, “and then came the most startling
disclosure of all.”</p>

<p>“Which was?” inquired the Doctor.</p>

<p>“They then informed me,” said the Colonel solemnly,
“that they had entered the cave and had been
there since June the tenth, nineteen hundred!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Since June the tenth, nineteen hundred!” exclaimed
the Doctor. “Extraordinary! Marvelous!
Still the case is not without some precedents. The
famous Doctor Fredicus, of Berlin, reports a case of
suspended animation lasting for ten months, but anything
like the lapse of time in this case is certainly
without parallel.”</p>

<p>“I trust that you do not doubt our word,” said
Kearns with dignity.</p>

<p>But the Professor turned upon him.</p>

<p>“Doubt our word!” he exclaimed. “Who could
credit such a preposterous statement without some
tangible evidence to support it. We must appear in
the light of either falsifiers or lunatics!”</p>

<p>“Doubt your word!” exclaimed the Colonel impulsively.
“I beg you not to think of such construction.
There may be some mistake, some possible inaccuracy;
but, if so, I am convinced it is entirely unintentional.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Professor gratefully; “I’m
unable to think clearly just now owing to this very
perplexing situation in which we find ourselves, but
is there not some way by which our statement could
be effectively tested and either proved, or disproved?”</p>

<p>“A good idea!” exclaimed Kearns. “Yes;
surely there must be many ways. The newspapers,
for instance; they must certainly have reported our
disappearance. In your public libraries there are
undoubtedly bound copies of the newspapers of that
period. That is,” he added, turning doubtfully to
the Colonel, “if public libraries have not ceased to
exist in these times, like the horse, the high ball, and
other cherished institutions.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Colonel, laughing, “we still
have public libraries, and noble ones, thanks to numerous
karnegians on the part of wealthy decedents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Numerous what, did you say?” inquired Kearns.</p>

<p>“Karnegians,” repeated the Colonel. “Oh, perhaps
that’s a new word to you. ‘To karnegy’ is a
verb meaning the acquirement of a mania for post-mortem
advertising and for leaving one’s wealth to
public institutions, to the disappointment of one’s
heirs. The noun ‘karnegian’ is defined as the gift
of such character. But,” continued the Colonel,
“we need not resort to the public libraries. Here in
my own library, which you will find a very fair one,
there are bound newspaper files stretching back over
a period of many years. The collection was begun
by my grandfather and I have hoped I might complete
it to a full century of newspapers.”</p>

<p>“Might we inspect the files at once?” asked the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be safe?” asked the Colonel,
turning to the Doctor. “Would it not be better
to postpone this until later and examine your patients
at once?”</p>

<p>“Having slept seventy-five years,” replied Kearns,
“I assure you we are thoroughly rested and quite up
to the test.”</p>

<p>“When I do begin my examination,” said the Doctor,
“I shall want to make it a very thorough one.
I suspect I shall find that animation has been absolutely
suspended during this period and that nature
will simply resume where she left off—just as after
a night’s sleep. If I refuse my patients’ request it
is likely to act upon the nervous system and possibly
throw them into an irritated and excited condition.
I think we might safely look into the matter now,
provided they will first partake of a little light nourishment.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” exclaimed the Colonel. “They must
be fairly starved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Under Dr. O’Hanlenne’s directions, a light but
nutritious meal was promptly served, which the two
partook of with relish.</p>

<p>The repast over, the Colonel, followed by his
guests, led the way across the hall to the elevator.
He touched an electric button and they quickly ascended
two stories. The Colonel then conducted
them down the hall and into a magnificent library.
Books lined the four walls from floor to ceiling.</p>

<p>“We’ll find what we want here,” said the Colonel,
crossing to one corner of the library. “The files for
that period are bound in four volumes to the year.
Let me see—we want June, nineteen hundred.
That will be the second volume of that year. Ah,
here it is.”</p>

<p>The Colonel picked out a big volume and laid it on
one of the polished library tables.</p>

<p>“June the tenth is the date, I believe? By the
way,” he added, turning to Kearns, “may I ask the
names?”</p>

<p>“My name is Thomas Kearns and I am, or rather
was——”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the Colonel, with a start,
“not Thomas Kearns, the famous Director of Police,
the great Vidocq of that period, whose name has figured
so often in the sensational romances of the
writer, Branderhurst?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Kearns modestly, “I believe I
was pretty well known in connection with police matters
in my day, but you do me altogether too much
honor. As for Branderhurst: I’m sorry, but I never
heard of him!”</p>

<p>“True,” said the Colonel, “he wrote after your
day. What the French authors did for Vidocq,
Branderhurst has done for you. You are known to
our girls and boys, and readers of sensational literature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
generally, as a Fouché and a Vidocq rolled into
one. In a word, as the great American Director of
Secret Police.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t quite style it that way in my day,”
answered Kearns, “but I suppose it’s all right. A
rose under any other name would smell just as sweet!
As for Branderhurst, I’m sure I’m obliged to him for
acting as a gratuitous post-mortem press agent.
What can I do to repay him, I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Not much, I fear,” replied the Colonel, “inasmuch
as poor Branderhurst, who was really a very
talented poet and novelist, died in delirium tremens
nearly a quarter of a century ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” said Kearns apologetically; “it used
to be much the same thing with writers in the old
days.”</p>

<p>“And now,” inquired the Colonel, turning to the
Professor, “may I ask your name?”</p>

<p>“Walter Stuart Dean,” answered the Professor.
“And,” he added with a smile, “I fear I cannot lay
any claim to distinction such as possessed by my
friend here, for in my period I was nothing but a
poor pedagogue and——”</p>

<p>But the Professor stopped abruptly, for both the
Colonel and the Doctor had turned toward him with
faces flushed and eager.</p>

<p>“Walter Stuart Dean!” repeated the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Walter Stuart Dean!” echoed the Colonel.
“Are you the famous writer on political economy;
the distinguished inventor and scientist?”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” urged the Professor deprecatingly,
“I beg you not to fall into any error. There is some
mistake here. It is true I wrote a work on political
economy, but far from making me famous, it cost me
my position as one of the Faculty at the Chicago University.
As for my investigations in science, whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
might have been the result, practically it was
nothing, since at the critical moment I—I disappeared!”</p>

<p>“Mistake, eh!” cried the Colonel, eagerly interposing;
“we will see about that!” And he hurried
away to another part of the library, returning a moment
later with a big encyclopedia.</p>

<p>“What do I find here?” he asked, consulting the
index and rapidly turning over the pages. “Ah,
here it is!   ‘Walter Stuart Dean, political economist,
scientist and inventor; born at Springfield, Illinois,
1857, of poor but honest parents. Studied in the
public schools and afterward at the University of
Bonn, Germany, from which he graduated, 1880,
with high honors. Filled the Chair of Professor of
Sciences at the University of Chicago, 1890-1900,
from which he retired owing to political persecution.
Wrote several famous works on political economy and
the economic conditions of the period; also a number
of notable scientific treatises. His mysterious disappearance
in 1900 was one of the sensations of the day.
The date of his death and place of burial are unknown.’
Now, sir, what do you say to that?” exclaimed
the Colonel, tapping with his index finger
upon the page before him. “Do you still think there
is any mistake?”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Kearns triumphantly, waving
his hand in the air. “This is indeed a case of a man
waking up to find himself famous. I congratulate
you, Professor.”</p>

<p>“Let me add my felicitations,” said Dr. O’Hanlenne.</p>

<p>“And mine!” declared the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the Professor, with the air
of a man somewhat dazed.</p>

<p>“And now,” exclaimed the Colonel, “having solidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
ensconced you in your respective niches of fame,
let us continue our original line of research. Let us
see if in these newspapers there is any account of
your mysterious disappearance.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Dr. O’Hanlenne.</p>

<p>“June tenth,” began the Colonel, turning the
paper, “no use looking on that date. June the eleventh.
Ah! here we are. Phew! your disappearance
did make a stir and your papers of that day understood
the art of working up a sensation. See the
great black headlines: ‘Triple Tragedy! Death
Amid the Lightning and the Storm. Mysterious
Disappearances of a Famous New Yorker and his
Companion. The Whole Countryside engaged in
Organized Search for the Missing Ones.’ Well, well,
well, gentlemen! What more could you ask than
that?”</p>

<p>All bent eagerly over the Colonel’s shoulder and
read. There was the whole story set forth; how
Kearns and the Professor had been temporarily sojourning
at Dr. Belden’s well-known Sanatorium;
how in the early afternoon of June tenth they had
started out in company with Dr. Jaquet; their failure
to return; the search which had followed and the
finding of the dead body of Dr. Jaquet by the wayside,
under the great oak, blasted and riven by the
lightning stroke. The article went on to describe
how all search for the Doctor’s companions had so far
proved utterly without result. Then followed biographical
sketches of the missing men.</p>

<p>They turned over the files and saw how day after
day the papers had kept up the sensation; how rewards
were offered by the many friends of Thomas
Kearns for any information as to his whereabouts,
living or dead. Then came the news of a monster
subscription for the purpose of thoroughly dragging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the rivers and otherwise continuing the search. Next
came theories as to the causes of the disappearance.
Had they become deranged and wandered away?
This theory was discussed at length, but it hardly
seemed tenable that two men should have simultaneously
become mentally afflicted. Another theory was
advanced that Kearns and his companion had been
made away with by an organized band of malefactors,
who either sought revenge upon Kearns or feared certain
discoveries he might have made. Thus the news
of the search and the various theories advanced kept
up edition after edition, until the articles grew
shorter and shorter and at last stopped altogether.
The nine days’ wonder had ceased longer to be a wonder;
the mystery had passed into the long list of unsolved
tragedies with which the past teems.</p>

<p>“What a queer thing it is,” commented Kearns
with a laugh, glancing over his biography, “that a
man has to be dead before the world finds out how
good and great he was.”</p>

<p>“I think you will find that has been the case in all
generations,” replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>“And poor Dr. Jaquet!” remarked the Professor.
“To think that he should have come to his end so
tragically and so suddenly after leaving us!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Kearns moodily; “our setting
out that June day would seem to have been an unfortunate
event for all three of us!”</p>

<p>“Come, cheer up!” retorted the Colonel; “thank
your lucky stars you are still alive and living in a
world which I think you will find materially improved
in many respects as compared to that of your
time.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed Kearns doubtfully, “tell us
then, of this new world of yours.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” answered the Colonel; “your strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and nerves have already been sufficiently tried. For
the moment, I insist upon turning you over to the
Doctor.”</p>

<small>THE STORY OF THE PAST</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“You ancient coxcomb!” exclaimed Kearns next
morning, as he watched the Professor struggling with
the intricacies of a new-fangled necktie, “to think
of a man more than one hundred years old giving
himself up to the vanities of life!”</p>

<p>“You, too, O venerable centenarian, seem to have
given some attention in the same direction,” retorted
the Professor. “I must confess, though, that those
knee-breeches and hose are very becoming to you, considering
your advanced age!”</p>

<p>“You think so?” replied Kearns. “I must say
that the clothes of this period are certainly more picturesque
and quite as comfortable as those of our
day.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he turned his eyes in the direction of
an assortment of clothing which their host had sent
up for their use. The styles had assuredly undergone
a change from the long trousers and somber-hued
clothes to which Kearns and the Professor had been
accustomed. Knee-breeches and hose replaced the
long trousers and the waistcoats were in lively patterns.</p>

<p>They had been conducted the night before to two
comfortable adjoining rooms and after being carefully
examined by Dr. O’Hanlenne, had partaken of a second
light repast, succeeded by a sound night’s rest.
This morning the Doctor had again visited them before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
they were up and, after careful examination,
had pronounced their condition sound, leaving
them with assurances that they could safely resume
the ordinary occupations of life. Then came a servant
with an invitation from their host to join him at
breakfast.</p>

<p>An hour later, at his guests’ urgent request, the
Colonel conducted them to the library there to impart
to them information regarding the changed order of
things. Having seated them in comfortable armchairs,
the Colonel produced a box of cigars.</p>

<p>“You smoke?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Both assented.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed the Colonel, as he passed the
box, “that’s at least one custom which you will find
has not changed.”</p>

<p>The Colonel lighted his cigar and settled back in
his chair, preparatory to opening his narrative.</p>

<p>“As you have already learned,” he began, “this
land in which we live is no longer the Republic of the
United States of America. All that is changed. We
live to-day in the Empire of the United States under
the beneficent rule of His Majesty, Imperial and
Royal, William the First, Emperor of the United
States, King of the Empire State of New York,
Grand Duke of Mexico and Costa Rica, Sovereign
Lord of Cuba and the Philippines, Mikado of the
Province of Ling-Toa, Nihor of Benaria. The states
composing the old Republic of the United States
have been consolidated into thirty states, each of
which is governed by a Viceroy, excepting the Empire
State of New York, of which the Emperor is
King. Thus in national matters we refer to the
Emperor, but in state matters to the King.”</p>

<p>“An Empire and an Emperor!” gasped the Professor.
“The Republic gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Who would ever have believed it!” cried Kearns.</p>

<p>“To our modern thinkers and writers,” said the
Colonel calmly, “the one great, inexplicable thing is
that the people of the beginning of this century—the
people of your time—did not plainly foresee just
what has happened. As our leading historian, Goldstream,
points out, all the history of the past, all the
indications of the times, pointed clearly to this culmination.
And I agree with Goldstream that it
would really seem that it did not require a prophet,
or the son of a prophet, to foreshadow what actually
happened.”</p>

<p>“I am deeply interested,” said the Professor, “yet
I do not quite follow your line of reasoning. Will
you particularize a little more fully, please?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” answered the Colonel. “As I
have just remarked, Goldstream draws attention to
the fact that the history of the past all pointed to the
Empire. By this he refers to the history of all the
old-time republics. What has that history been?
First, a republic, and honest, sturdy simplicity; next,
a growth of wealth, followed by a constantly increasing
luxury. And what was the outcome of these conditions
in all these republics? Class distinction,
founded upon a plutocratic basis; and official and industrial
corruption born of the wild scramble after
wealth and its ostentatious fooleries. These conditions
have ever proved the soil from which a ruling
class has sprung, followed by a monarchy and an aristocracy.
Read the ancient histories, and there you
find it recorded again and again.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true in many respects,” said the
Professor; “but what signs do you discover in our
times which foreshadowed the passing of the Republic
and the installing of the monarchical institution?”</p>

<p>“The very first signs,” answered the Colonel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
“are to be traced to the close of the nineteenth century.
As can be gleaned from the literature of that
period, sons of the rich men were beginning to ape
the dress, the manners and the modes of speech of the
gilded youth of England. A wave of what was then
called Anglomania swept over the country. If a foreign
nobleman, even a poverty-stricken German baron,
or a beggarly Italian count, came into the country, he
was fêted, entertained and run after by your Society
and toadied to in a manner of which the smallest London
shopkeeper, or the humblest <i>bourgeois</i> of the
Paris <i>faubourgs</i> would have been ashamed. If an
adventurer of that period called himself my Lord
This or Sir Henry That, people straightway lost
their heads and their money. I ask you if this has,
or has not, been correctly reported?”</p>

<p>Kearns laughed. “What memories your words
bring to me!” he said. “I could tell you of some
extraordinary cases. But don’t let me interrupt.”</p>

<p>“The beginning of this century,” continued the
Colonel, “found your Republic of the United States
growing rapidly in wealth, in luxury, and in class
distinctions. The literature of the times points
clearly to the existence of a class which considered
itself superior to the ordinary citizen. Some of the
writers of the period seem to have placed the numbers
of this class at four hundred, but this originally limited
number must certainly have largely increased
later on, as new fortunes were made and new millionaires
sprang into existence.”</p>

<p>“The Four Hundred!” exclaimed Kearns.
“Why, that was originally regarded as a species of
joke sprung by one Ward McAllister.”</p>

<p>“It evidently turned out a pretty grim joke for
the Republic!” retorted the Professor dryly.</p>

<p>“All these things were straws clearly indicating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the direction to which the wind was veering,” resumed
the Colonel. “A large percentage of the
members of this class, denominated even in the days
of the Republic as ‘High Society,’ lived in Europe,
where they could bask in the sunshine of aristocracy
and at times even creep within the shadow of a throne.
The one dream of the members possessed of marriageable
daughters in this ‘High Society’ was to marry
off such daughters to European aristocrats. The
multi-millionaires of the period aspired to a match
with an English Duke or Earl; those of lesser millions
were compelled to put up with a French Count, or a
German Baron. No woman was too beautiful, no
<i>dot</i> too great, provided a title were involved. No
personality was too repulsive, no reputation or character
too vile, provided they were gilded over by a patent
of nobility. Do the chronicles that tell of these
things lie, or do they record the truth?”</p>

<p>“The frozen truth!” answered Kearns curtly.</p>

<p>“Then how can you say,” cried the Colonel triumphantly,
“that the coming events did not cast their
shadows before? What meant these things if not an
aching and a longing for aristocracy? And you can’t
very well have an aristocracy without a monarchy!
It is the most natural sequence of events in the
world,” continued the Colonel argumentatively;
“first wealth, next luxury, then a desire to be distinguished
above the common herd. After all the physical
appetites are satisfied comes the craving for honors
and distinction, for decorations and titles!”</p>

<p>“But,” interposed the Professor with a bewildered
air, “how came the People—the masses of the People—to
ever submit to these changes?”</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut! The People!” exclaimed the Colonel
contemptuously. “How much had they to say
in the matter! The power of the People is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
those cant phrases, founded on a popular delusion,
which have always existed. In theory, the power of
the People is supreme; in reality, a myth. Take it
during the past two thousand years. In all these
centuries the great masses of the people have been
poor, hardworking; their lives replete with stint and
suffering. The Few have been rich, pampered, over-indulged
and contented. Do you think the masses of
the People were really satisfied with this order of
things? Do you not believe that they, both as individuals
and as a mass, would infinitely have preferred
a more even distribution of the good things of this
world? At any time and in any country, these
masses, had they been organized and united in purpose,
could in a day have changed the conditions and
brought about this coveted distribution. But they
never have been so organized and united, and the special
class has ever governed the masses. True, there
were your labor unions and your great strikes. Contractors
and employers, great and small, were bullied
and at times even beaten in the various struggles
which ensued, but this really amounted to nothing.
Whenever the People really began to grow dangerous
and to threaten the existing order of things, the soldiers
came forth—soldiers, mark you, drawn from
the masses—and the trouble was promptly put an
end to.”</p>

<p>“But how about the popular vote?” inquired the
Professor.</p>

<p>“The popular vote,” echoed the Colonel with a
sneer. “Another delusion! One set of professional
politicians set up a platform against another platform
devised by another set of professional politicians and
both invite the popular vote. The good people would
vote for the one, or for the other; but how much was
the popular interest, or the popular will, really represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
by either? It is true that from time to time
reformers sprang up and sought to create new parties
and new issues more closely representative of the popular
weal and the popular will. How much headway
did they make? Defeat by the trained political organizations,
commanding ample means and patronage,
was invariably the ultimate fate of any such efforts.
The really able man preferred to accept the
existing conditions and make the best of them. He
realized the futility of such undertakings and understood
that the rôle of Reformer and the rôle of Martyr
were only too closely allied.”</p>

<p>“But in a supreme question,” objected the Professor,
“such as the overthrow of the Republic, I should
have thought that a naturally free, assertive people,
such as the people of the United States, would have
made their power felt.”</p>

<p>“Another popular fallacy!” laughed the Colonel.
“The people of the United States are a brave people—valorous
in war; pushing, clever, enterprising in
times of peace. They exalt national heroes to the
skies one day, only to pull them down the next. They
are super-sensitive to adverse criticism and delight in
being told they are the greatest and best of the earth.
These are among their many little peculiarities, but to
describe them as a people strongly assertive of their
rights is to describe wrongly.”</p>

<p>“I can’t agree with you,” said the Professor
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Look back fairly and impartially,” answered the
Colonel gently, “and I think you will find my words
borne out. Take New York—your own city and in
your own times. Was ever in any land, or at any
period, such arbitrary disregard of the People’s
rights submitted to with practically not a murmur of
dissent? Do you question this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I will leave it to you to make out your own case,”
retorted the Professor.</p>

<p>“Make out my case,” returned the Colonel with
warmth; “very well, then! Is it or is it not true
that valuable franchises belonging to the People were
acquired by trick and device far below their actual
value? Is it or is it not true that official corruption
was openly and notoriously rampant on every side;
that judges sat upon the bench because they were the
political creatures of a political boss; nominated and
elected, not because of their integrity, or knowledge
of the Law, but at the behest of a party leader? The
same conditions prevailed amongst the prosecuting
officers, so that Justice itself was sullied at her very
fountain head. Your police force was nothing more
nor less than an organized banditti, clothed with the
uniform of law and order and paid by the People;
but dispensing oppression and levying blackmail right
and left. Am I citing individual cases, or acts done
occasionally and in secrecy? Indeed not! The
chronicles of your time recite that all this was a matter
of daily occurrence and common notoriety—that
the very children making mud pies in your gutters
knew of it. Then, too, the pages of municipal history
are seared with the shameful record of an executive
officer who, with others, manipulated a corner in
a certain product necessary to the rich and poor.
The chronicles record how the conspirators controlling
the corner forced up the price at a time when the
product was most needed to relieve suffering. The
price was prohibitive to the poor. And the women
and the little children in your teeming tenements laid
down their lives—hundreds upon hundreds of them.
But the corner was piling up money for your officer
and his associates, and they heeded not the cries of
death and despair. The papers of the time were replete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
with itemized accounts of the suffering, but
none raised a hand to stop the iniquity. Is this true,
or does history lie?”</p>

<p>“But the People,” exclaimed the Professor, “were
not responsible—they did not approve——”</p>

<p>“Approve!” cried the Colonel explosively; “much
credit to them for that! Do you think the People of
England, or of France, would have thus tamely submitted?
Even in darkest Russia, do you not think
there would have been a few signs of lack of approval
in the shape of bombs? Was there a violent ebullition
of popular wrath? Was there an outbreak
such as might have recalled the French Revolution of
1789? No; your free and assertive citizens tamely
submitted. The corporations kept their franchises;
the men of the soiled ermine retained their positions
on the bench; the police force, despite investigations
and exposures, continued, haughty and arrogant, to
ply its nefarious traffic; and it is recorded that the
officer to whom I have referred was allowed to quietly
and profitably serve out his term. Do I state facts,
or fiction?”</p>

<p>“You are stating only the truth,” said Kearns
sturdily.</p>

<p>“And the franchises which were robbed from the
People!” cried the colonel. “What was done with
them? Not content with securing these valuable
franchises infinitely below their actual worth, the
holders proceeded to form corporations whose stock
was watered to an absurd extent. Upon this watered
stock dividends had to be earned. And how were
these dividends earned—by the transportation
companies of the great cities, for instance? By
treating the people—to whom these companies owed
their corporate existence—like dogs, and transporting
them as they would not have dared to transport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
cattle. Men, women and children were herded
in the street cars of your day as animals were never
herded. Thus year in and year out were the great
and supposedly all-powerful People treated. And
for what? All for the benefit of a comparatively
tiny coterie of men, who derived the profit. And
the People submitted tamely as any band of sheep,
did they not? The power of the people, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Come, Colonel!” exclaimed the Professor; “it
seems to me that you are somewhat intolerant of the
shortcomings of the people of our day.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” replied the Colonel hastily, “if
I have said anything to offend, though I have only
recited a few facts as taken from the chroniclers of
your own times. Of course, we have our faults
and our evils; but not such as these. Thank God,
such things could not be under the Empire! Thank
God, such would not be tolerated under the beneficent
rule of His Majesty, the King! Long live
the Empire! God save the King!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE STAR OF EMPIRE</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“You would doubtless prefer to hear how the great
changes which have taken place were brought about
and learn of the events which led up to them,” continued
the Colonel. “For this we must go back to
the beginning of the century and the days when the
various great Trusts began to grow into maturity
and strength. Just prior to the beginning of the century
had come the formation of the gigantic financial
organizations known as the Trusts. That is to say,
they were regarded as gigantic in that day, though
as a matter of fact they had not yet assumed the
really colossal proportions they later attained. They
were then in their infancy, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“I can recall,” remarked Kearns, “a little billion-dollar
concern. Surely that was a pretty solid,
bouncing infant!”</p>

<p>“A beggarly, puny infant?” retorted the Colonel,
“as compared to those born later. The Trusts grew
until business upon anything but a colossal scale was
an impossibility and the smaller manufacturer and
the middleman were wiped out. In the course of
time, by a brilliant series of consolidations, seven
great Trusts were formed which practically absorbed
the business of the country. The fields covered by
these Trusts were respectively: Alimentation,
Transportation, Manufacturing, Land, Ores and Minerals,
Retailing, and finally, the great Miscellaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Trust which took in pretty well everything not embraced
by the others. These main Trusts subdivided
their respective fields between numerous subsidiary
Trusts; but these subsidiary Trusts all operated subject
to the direction of the general head of that particular
Trust. The methods adopted by these organizations
involved the ruthless crushing out of all outside
competition. For instance, the Retailing
Trust would start in by founding baker shops all
over a given city, and would sell bread at the actual
cost of production. With the enormous resources
at the disposal of the Trust, this plan of operations
could be kept up indefinitely. What was the result?
All rivals were forced either to sell out to the
Trust, or go to the wall. Similar methods of procedure
were adopted in other branches of retail industry,
one after the other, until the cream of the
retail trade in all the great cities was practically in
the hands of the Trust. It was a case of steady absorption.
To oppose the Trust meant ruin and this
speedily came to be very thoroughly understood.
Another example is the Alimentation Trust, which
deals with the foodstuffs, both solid and liquid, of
the country. With its enormous resources, it was
enabled to corner the raw material in one product
after another until all competition was forced out of
existence.”</p>

<p>“And what did the People say to all this?” inquired
Dean.</p>

<p>“They fussed and fumed a good deal,” answered
the Colonel, “but they submitted—just as they
submitted in your day to the cornering Chief Magistrate,
the corrupt judges, the official rascality, and
the oppressions of the transportation companies. At
first, inspired by the fulminations of certain newspapers,
organs of the populace, they assumed a rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
threatening attitude; but this soon died out. The
great Miscellaneous Trust founded newspapers, covering
immense fields of news. The highest talent in
the land was employed. The papers were delivered
free of charge throughout the city and surrounding
country. Money was no object. The dry-goods
business, the soap industry and the patent-medicine
output being all controlled by the Trusts, the field of
general advertising was well in their hands. Consequently
the independent newspapers were either sold
out to and absorbed by the Trust organs, or perished
from lack of advertising patronage.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they said some tart things before they
expired,” exclaimed Kearns.</p>

<p>“Frantic were their death shrieks!” replied the
Colonel. “However, as these disturbing factors
gradually disappeared, the people became more calm
and more accustomed to the existing state of things.
They began to perceive that the Trusts were, after
all, not an unmixed evil. While the Trusts made
enormous profits, yet the cost to the consumer, owing
to the reduction in the expenses of handling and production,
was materially reduced. The merchants
and manufacturers, the middlemen and retailers who
had been crowded out of business found positions
with the different Trusts, where they worked less
hard and had more freedom from financial cares than
they had known when they were in business for themselves.
And the Trusts were very shrewd. While
the bulk of their enormous capital stock was controlled
by certain individuals, yet a quantity of the
stock was put out among the masses of the people,
whose interest in this way became bound up with the
Trusts. Besides this, each of the Trusts, of course,
employed vast armies of people. These employes,
after attaining a certain age, were pensioned and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
their lives insured, in consideration of payments deducted
from the weekly, or monthly, wage. This
created a vast host of people throughout the land
whose financial interests, or whose entire future prospects,
were identified with the Trusts. Now, self-interest
is a very powerful incentive and these very
people were among the firmest supporters of the
Trusts. In the meantime, the United States was
rapidly taking its position as the foremost commercial,
manufacturing and exporting country in the
world, and this expansion of trade kept times good
and things prosperous generally. Do you follow
me?”</p>

<p>“To quite an extent,” answered Kearns.</p>

<p>“There are many questions I wish to ask,” said
the Professor, “but I prefer to reserve them until
later and not interrupt your narrative.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” continued the Colonel. “We now
come to the year 1963—the time of the outbreak
of the great battle of the Trusts. At that period,
William Rockingham, the richest man in the world
and the head of the great Miscellaneous Trust, was
President of the United States. He was the last to
fill that office. For a number of years there had been
discord between the Directorates of certain of the
seven great Trusts, growing out of charges and
counter charges of one infringing upon the fields
of the other. The discord developed into war. It
was a war of billions. For a long time the strife
raged, but at last it became plain with whom victory
would rest. The defeated ones, men of resources and
of influence, in the bitterness of defeat, brought
charges against the President and sought to impeach
him. It was charged that he had used his official
position as President to secure the victory to the
Miscellaneous Trust, of which he was the head, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
its allies. A bitter political fight ensued, followed by
an armed uprising.”</p>

<p>“The term of the President,” continued the Colonel,
“was drawing to a close and preparations being
made for the usual presidential nominations. The
heads of the great Trusts, flushed by their recent success,
got together and the cry went up that the constantly
recurring elections were a cause of commercial
disturbance and that a frequently changing occupant
of the presidential chair was a source of
national insecurity and of weakness in the country’s
foreign relations. The politicians were set to work
and a constitutional amendment proposed, in accordance
with which the President was to be elected for
life and Congress was authorized to institute such
other changes in the national form of government as
might be deemed necessary for the public welfare
and safety. William Rockingham received the nomination
from the party which advocated these constitutional
changes. I will not analyze how it came to
pass. The election which ensued was a complete
triumph for him. The constitutional amendment
was sanctioned by the popular vote and William
Rockingham found himself elected President for life,
with a Congress, under the leadership of the great
Marquanna, obedient to his lightest word.”</p>

<p>“The opening wedge!” commented Dean.</p>

<p>“There were charges advanced in connection with
this election,” resumed the Colonel, “and the uprising
I have mentioned became more formidable
than ever. Rumors began to be circulated broadcast
that certain classes were paving the way to a monarchy.
With a permanent President and a Congress
obedient to his every behest, the country might as
well, the cry went up, have a King at once.”</p>

<p>“I begin to see the trend of events,” murmured
Dean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“A King at once! And why not?” continued the
Colonel. “The country was certainly ripe for it. The
successful Trust controllers favored it and behind
them, as I have shown, were armies of people whose
entire interests were bound up in the Trusts and
who, consequently, favored whatever the Trusts desired.
The officers of the Army and of the Navy
favored it. Class distinction had ever flourished in
their ranks and a monarchy would mean that crosses
and decorations and all the brilliancy and advantages
of a court, as enjoyed by military and naval officers
in Europe, would be theirs. Society, of course, was
in favor of it to a unit and to the great majority of
the women throughout the land the proposition
seemed to come as a not displeasing novelty. In a
word, while there was bitter opposition to the idea
in many quarters, yet it did not want for enthusiastic
supporters in countless directions. As for Marquanna,
the great political chieftain, he boldly came
out with the declaration that the feature of a constantly
changing President had become intolerable
and that the country’s urgent need was greater stability
and permanence in its executive head. He was
not prepared to say whether the mere election of the
President for life would sufficiently satisfy the country’s
demands in this respect.”</p>

<p>“A bold leader! He had at least courage, if
nothing else!” remarked Dean.</p>

<p>“Owing to the condition of unrest in various parts
of the country,” continued the Colonel, “martial
law was proclaimed and the regular army was
brought into active play. In the midst of the general
turmoil and confusion, Congress, under the leadership
of Marquanna, decided to take advantage of
the recent constitutional amendment which provided
that such other and further action might be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
in modifying the form of national government as
for the welfare and safety of the people might be
deemed necessary. Boldly the resolution was sprung
providing that the existing Republic be transformed
into a hereditary monarchy, with the life President
as the Sovereign. By a substantial majority this was
carried. A cabinet was quickly formed; the boundaries
of the various states were rearranged and the
number of states reduced by consolidation to thirty,
with a Viceroy governing each; New York state
was declared the premier state, with the Ruler of the
Empire as its hereditary King, and the seat of government
was transferred from Washington to New
York; Marquanna was created Duke of Marquanna,
taking his title from the beautiful country seat which
bears his family name, and was also made Chancellor
of the Empire; crosses and orders were distributed
among the officers of the Army and the Navy,
and the great men of the country were ennobled according
to their respective degrees of prominence
and influence. Within sixty days the uprisings were
successfully crushed out by the army and the leaders
and instigators tried on charges of High Treason
and executed, or imprisoned. Then sprang into existence
the most brilliant and luxurious Court the
world had yet known. With imposing ceremonies
the first American monarch was crowned, amid the
applauding tributes of the Kings and peoples of
monarchical Europe.”</p>

<p>“And this is the—the—King who now rules?”
asked Dean.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Colonel. “His Majesty, William
the First, has since then reigned and his reign
has been one glorious in war and successful in peace,
as I shall have occasion to explain to you later. The
King is a man of great capabilities—able, sagacious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
and of strong will, but of late years he has grown very
fond of the gayeties of life, so much so that, like
Charles II. of England, he is often referred to as
‘The Merry Monarch.’ The brilliancy of his Court
has grown apace, and indeed it exceeds that of any
other reigning sovereign. But amid all this glitter
and gayety the affairs of State are well looked after.
The officers of the Chancellerie are in the palace itself,
and still at the helm is the stern old Chancellor—the
great American Lord Chancellor, His Grace,
the Duke of Marquanna.”</p>

<small>THE POT CALLS THE KETTLE BLACK</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“And who was the most beautiful woman of that
time and—and—what did she look like? Oh, do
tell me all about it. I’m so interested!”</p>

<p>So prattled away Beatrice, daughter of Colonel
Sir Maynard Cuming, sprightly and eighteen, as
she sat at the head of the breakfast table, and
daintily served Kearns and the Professor with their
tea. The Colonel was a widower and this little lady—half
woman, half child still—with her handsome
dark eyes and arch, impetuous ways was his only
daughter.</p>

<p>“Do tell me all about it,” she continued pleadingly.
“I want to know all about her. The books—histories
and things like that—tell a lot of things
which are not at all interesting and leave out the
most important things of all. Who was the most
beautiful woman?”</p>

<p>Both Kearns and the Professor seemed quite perplexed.</p>

<p>The Colonel laughed. “Now you are confronted
with a poser,” he said. “This might be a rather
awkward question under some circumstances, but you
can certainly answer it without danger of making
any particular lady jealous.”</p>

<p>“Now, papa,” protested Beatrice, “please don’t
interrupt and lead away from my question.”</p>

<p>“I fear it is useless to appeal to me, Miss Cuming,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
finally answered the Professor. “My friend,
I imagine, is better qualified to answer such a question.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that!” exclaimed
Kearns; “I’ve noticed that you scientists, for all
your air of scientific abstraction, have very often an
exceedingly keen eye to feminine charms and graces.
Who was the most beautiful woman? How can one
answer such a question when all the women of—of—our
day were so beautiful! In those days, to
walk up Broadway from Twenty-third to Thirty-fourth
streets, on a bright afternoon, was to see a
galaxy of American beauty and Paris fashions pass
in review.”</p>

<p>“Broadway, between Twenty-third and Thirty-fourth
streets,” repeated Miss Beatrice. “Where
is that, papa?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear,” answered the Colonel, “that’s
a part of the city given over entirely to the business
section. You have never been there.”</p>

<p>“I see!” answered Beatrice thoughtfully. “But
what did you say about Paris fashions, Mr.
Kearns? Did the ladies in those days get their
fashions from Paris?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Kearns. “Paris was
then considered the great centre from which all the
fashions in dresses and bonnets were procured.”</p>

<p>“What a funny idea!” laughed the girl. “To-day,”
she continued proudly, “our capital and our
Court give the fashions to the world.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to learn it,” exclaimed Kearns with
enthusiasm. “It should have been the same in our
day, as far as New York and the fashions were concerned.
As a matter of fact, it was so to a greater
extent than was then generally imagined. Dresses
and hats which were labeled as made in Paris were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
in reality, manufactured in New York. American
skill and taste really were matchless, but the popular
fad of that day was to demand Paris-made articles
and the enterprising shopkeeper filled that demand
by furnishing Paris goods—made in America.”</p>

<p>“All that is changed now,” said the Colonel. “As
Trixy says, to-day American fashions concededly lead
the world.”</p>

<p>A servant entered, extending to the Colonel a silver
salver upon which lay a letter.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the Colonel, as he broke the
seal. “Ah! this is indeed news!” he exclaimed,
as he rapidly read. “We are shortly to have with
us a most distinguished visitor.”</p>

<p>“Who is it, papa?” inquired Beatrice with
curiosity.</p>

<p>“General Mainwarren,” answered the Colonel. “I
must tell you about him before he arrives,” he added,
turning to his guests. “General Mainwarren, who,
by the way, is a distant cousin of ours, was a most
distinguished soldier during the war with Russia.”</p>

<p>“What! Has the United States been at war with
Russia?” exclaimed Kearns and the Professor in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Colonel, “that is one of the
many events which I have not yet had an opportunity
to tell to you. Our commercial interests with Great
Britain became so great, and the amount of our surplus
capital invested in British enterprises so large,
that a defensive alliance with that country grew to be
a matter of necessity. When the integrity of the
British Empire and incidentally the safety of our
commercial interests came to be imperiled by the
encroachments of the great barbaric Power of the
North, it was found necessary for the United States
to step in and lend a helping hand. The war with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Russia was long and bloody and Napoleon’s famous
invasion of the Russian Empire was duplicated by
the allied armies of the United States and Great
Britain. Great battles were fought; great victories
were won and—needless to say—we eventually
triumphed.”</p>

<p>“How could it be otherwise! What can withstand
the Anglo-Saxon race!” exclaimed the Professor
proudly.</p>

<p>“To think that all this should have been going on
and I asleep!” cried Kearns regretfully.</p>

<p>“But I must hurry and tell you about General
Mainwarren,” continued the Colonel. “As I said
before, he distinguished himself during this war
with Russia; became the pride of the people and the
idol of his soldiers. After the war, he fell into disfavor,
owing to views which were regarded as—as—disloyal.
He was opposed to the general economic
conditions—to the Trusts and the power wielded by
them. This was strange, inasmuch as his elder
brother was the head of the great Ores and Minerals
Trust, of which the Coal Trust was one of the subsidiary
organizations. I never knew the precise rights
of the matter, but the General fell into disfavor and
was retired from active service on half pay. He
was not honored with a title as had been officers of
far less distinguished service, but was studiously ignored
in this respect by the Sovereign. For a brief
period he lived in comparative poverty and obscurity.
His brother’s only son was fatally injured one day
in an accident. The news was carried to the young
man’s father. He was an old man and its suddenness
overwhelmed him. He dropped where he stood
and never recovered consciousness. Everything he
possessed had been left to his only son and this son
survived the father by only a few hours, dying intestate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
His uncle, the General, was the only relative
and he inherited everything as the heir-at-law
of the son. Thus, in one day, he saw himself lifted
into the position of one of the richest men in the
country.”</p>

<p>“What a strange turn of fortune!” exclaimed the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Colonel; “but that is not all
there is to tell. After he came into these immense
properties, a change seemed to pass over him. Where
before he had figured as the friend of the masses, he
now appeared as the direct reverse. In fact, various
industrial measures adopted by him were of so grasping,
uncompromising and offensive a character as to
draw forth widespread condemnation. Even the government
protested. It regarded his line of action as
calculated to foment public discontent and was, therefore,
a menace. And so it came about that where his
championship of popular rights had before drawn
upon him the displeasure of the Throne, he was now
in disfavor at Court for his radical course in precisely
the opposite direction. Curious, is it not?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way of mankind,” commented Kearns.
“It was the same in our day. One kind of a man
in adversity and a totally different kind of a man in
prosperity. How often one sees that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what they say of Cousin Mainwarren,”
interposed Beatrice warmly. “I believe he
has a kind heart. But to come back to our subject,”
she added, addressing Kearns, “is it true that the
ladies at that time——”</p>

<p>Her question was interrupted by the entrance of
a servant, who announced the arrival of General
Mainwarren. The Colonel hurried out to receive
him.</p>

<p>A few moments later he returned, accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
by a man of most striking personality. He was tall
beyond the usual height, broad shouldered and massive,
with a large, strong face, every line and contour
of which was indicative of resolution and power.</p>

<p>The new-comer greeted Beatrice with cheery courtesy
and the Colonel presented General Mainwarren
to his guests.</p>

<p>“I need not disguise from you, gentlemen,” said
the General, “that I know of the experiences through
which you’ve passed. The wildest rumors on the
subject are current in Pemberton and the newspapers
are full of them. However, I trust you won’t allow
this to distress you. May I ask how you like the new
condition of things?” The General turned a keen
and searching glance upon them as he put the question.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed the Professor, “it used to be the
custom with the reporters of our day, when foreigners
landed upon our shores, to inquire how they
liked the country. As the visitor’s actual experience
consisted of a five minutes’ sojourn on the dock, the
question was naturally difficult to answer. It seems
to me we are much in the same position.”</p>

<p>“So you are,” answered the General, smiling. “I
may say to you, however, that you will find things
much changed—much improved in some respects,
you will, perhaps, decide.”</p>

<p>“How do you happen to be traveling this way?”
asked Beatrice, with a woman’s curiosity.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the General, with a light laugh,
“there’s a story connected with that. I’ve been favored
with a special summons to attend at Court—to
be received in special audience by His Majesty and
the Chancellor.”</p>

<p>The Colonel looked up sharply and turned a quick,
inquiring glance upon the speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“There—is—no—new—trouble?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the General lightly. “It is
usually a sign of favor for a subject to be summoned
to attend the Court of the King. In my case perhaps——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and glanced toward Beatrice.</p>

<p>The young lady rose quickly from the table.</p>

<p>“I know you want to discuss business and politics
and horrid things of that kind,” she exclaimed petulantly,
“so I’ll disappear. But you and I,” she continued,
turning to the General, “will have a little
<i>tête-à-tête</i> before you leave, won’t we? If you are
going to Court, you can take a message to Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” smilingly answered the General, and
Beatrice tripped from the room.</p>

<p>“I think we might take a turn in the garden,”
remarked the Professor to Kearns.</p>

<p>“No, no; please don’t go,” exclaimed the General.
“I’ll be indebted if you will remain. I would like
to have your opinion on certain matters.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?” said the Professor hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Quite, quite sure,” declared the General. “Pray
be seated.”</p>

<p>The Professor sank back into his seat.</p>

<p>“There’s some trouble, I feel convinced,” said the
Colonel with an air of concern.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered General Mainwarren, “I’ll relieve
you of any suspense. I’ve been summoned to
Court to confer with the Emperor and his Chancellor
regarding certain operations contemplated by the
Coal Trust, of which,” he added with an explanatory
wave of the hand to the Professor and Kearns, “I
am the head.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” interjected the Colonel; “but what’s
the nature of these new operations?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Simply this,” replied the General carelessly; “it
has been decided, to describe the plan briefly, to withhold
the output of coal and to force up the price during
the coming winter to fifteen crowns the ton.”</p>

<p>“No, no; surely not!” cried the Colonel.</p>

<p>“It has been decided and will be done,” said General
Mainwarren firmly. “The Sovereign, the Chancellor
and the Imperial Council are much exercised,
I understand, in view of the effect it is likely to have
upon the masses. Hence my summons to Court!
And,” continued the General, turning to the Professor,
“what do you say to this plan? You had certain
experiences of this kind in your day, did you
not?”</p>

<p>“I must decline to express an opinion,” answered
the Professor coldly. “I’m not sufficiently familiar
with existing conditions to express an opinion. How
am I to know what will be the effect upon the people
at large?”</p>

<p>“It will result in widespread suffering and distress;
in misery of the most dreadful kind,” said the
Colonel, sadly.</p>

<p>“Say, if you like,” replied General Mainwarren
with brutal directness, “that it will result in widespread
desolation and death. You may speak out.
I’m not thin-skinned and don’t mind hearing the
truth. Many factories must close and tens of thousands
will be thrown out of work; to say nothing of
the misery and death which will ensue from actual
cold. Hence the Court is exercised; hence it sends
for me, but—it will be in vain!”</p>

<p>“And you,” said the Professor, turning horror-stricken
eyes upon the speaker, “realizing all these
things, will still persist in your course!”</p>

<p>“Absolutely and unalterably,” answered the General
sternly. “I’ve been sent for to present myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
at Court. I’ll be wheedled, pleaded with, threatened
and cajoled, but—it will be for naught. Ah, you
seem astonished. What, then, is the view you take?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the Professor, rising, his eyes flashing
in indignation and anger, “you have twice asked
my opinion and I’ll give it, fully and freely, as man
to man. I consider that any man who will heartlessly
throw tens of thousands of working men out of employment;
who will expose tens of thousands to
misery and want; who will let women and children
languish and die from privation and cold, is a monster
in human form—a fiend incarnate! His fellow
men should turn from him in horror and in loathing;
his mother reproach herself that she gave him birth.
That’s my opinion, sir. God created these coal lands
for the benefit of humanity in general. It is preposterous
to suppose that He created them for the exclusive
benefit of any one man, or set of men. The government
that permits such action as you wish to take
is unworthy to stand; it should be swept out of existence!”</p>

<p>“My dear Professor!” interjected Kearns, endeavoring
to allay his companion’s warmth; “are
you not a little too vehement?”</p>

<p>“You will pardon me,” said the Professor, turning
to Colonel Cuming, “but I can’t retract, or even
modify, my words. I thank you for your kindly hospitality,
which I have but ill-repaid. I’ll now withdraw
from your presence and your house.”</p>

<p>General Mainwarren had listened with flushed face
and contracted brows.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he interposed hastily, “no apology is
either necessary or proper. I asked your opinion;
you’ve given it. An honest opinion is always deserving
of respect; the more frank and outspoken, the
better it is. That which I take exception to is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the words themselves, but at such words from you—<span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>!”</p>

<p>“From me!” exclaimed the Professor. “And
why particularly from me?”</p>

<p>“From you, sir,” continued the General, with fiery
emphasis, “or from any man of your day. Isn’t it to
the men of your day that we owe the examples we follow?
If I mistake not it was precisely the men of
your time who first taught to this land the lesson of
the concentration of capital; wasn’t it your capitalists
who first promulgated the theory of their divine appointment
to the control of the good things of this
world?”</p>

<p>“That theory was the theory of the Few; not of the
Many,” objected the Professor.</p>

<p>“It was certainly tolerated and permitted by the
people of your time,” retorted General Mainwarren,
“and in pursuing my course I’m only following out
that which has been a sanctioned time-honored custom.
If the people objected to these things, the
proper time to have stopped them was when they
first began. I forgive your words, Professor Dean;
I bear no rancor. But such words coming from a
man of your era is, upon my honor, like the pot calling
the kettle black!”</p>

<p>The Professor was about to reply, but his answer
was cut short by the entry of a servant, bringing a
card to Colonel Cuming. The Colonel took the card
from the salver, glanced at it and gave a direction to
the servant, who immediately retired.</p>

<p>Rising and holding between his fingers the card
which had been brought to him, he faced the others:</p>

<p>“A messenger from His Majesty, the King,” he
said.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>MR. KEARNS HAS A PREMONITION</small></h3>
</div>

<p>For some moments after the Colonel had left the
room the three men sat in silence. Then General
Mainwarren turned to the Professor.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me if my words have been too
blunt,” he said courteously; “but students of sociology
agree that the conditions of the present epoch
had their origin in your day; that such origin can be
distinctly traced back; and that with the men of your
time lies the responsibility for whatever exists to-day.”</p>

<p>“And you, I trust, will pardon any undue warmth
on my side,” replied the Professor, “but this I must
say; however much you may be disposed to blame the
people of my day, you, personally, if you will permit
me to say so, seem disposed to carry out measures far
more arbitrary and drastic than were ever adopted in
our time.”</p>

<p>“You refer to the measures I spoke of in relation
to the coal supply?” asked General Mainwarren.</p>

<p>“Yes. Certainly you don’t claim that God, or
Nature—call it what you will—placed those deposits
exclusively for your benefit and that you can
deal with them absolutely as you will, regardless of
the rights, interests or welfare of humanity in general?”</p>

<p>“It was ill-advised,” retorted the General, slowly
and with emphasis, “for you to raise that point.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
If you will remember, it was in your time that that
very point was first set up.”</p>

<p>“I fail to recall——”</p>

<p>“Surely not! Wasn’t it in your day that the claim
was for the first time advanced that these very coal
deposits were vested in certain hands by divine appointment
and that the right to manage such properties
must be left solely and entirely to the discretion
of those whom the Almighty had so selected? Wasn’t
this question of divine right advanced, for the first
time in the history of the Republic, in your day and—successfully
maintained?”</p>

<p>“How successfully maintained?”</p>

<p>“Can you even question! I have studied carefully
the history of the time and I at least know my
facts. Wasn’t the situation then critical enough?
The operators withheld the output. The people were
perishing from cold. Death stalked abroad. Had
not the State Government ample power to declare
that the public health and safety required the seizure
of those lands, with compensation, of course, to the
owners? This sovereignty right of eminent domain
was invoked when it was a question of putting
through a new street, or creating a right of way for
some quasi-public corporation. But when it came to
exercising the right against a powerful corporation, it
seems your suffering people feared to even whisperingly
advocate the measure. So,” continued the General,
“the people were permitted to languish and die
and the theory of divine right took its birth and, as
you perceive, has flourished apace since then.”</p>

<p>“By George! there’s a good deal of truth in what
you say!” exclaimed Kearns.</p>

<p>“When did these events occur to which you have
referred?” questioned the Professor.</p>

<p>“Early in the present century,” replied the General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“We must distinctly disclaim responsibility for
anything occurring after June the tenth, nineteen
hundred,” declared the Professor, with a smile.</p>

<p>“True, I had forgotten that!” replied General
Mainwarren with a laugh.</p>

<p>“But what I don’t understand,” said the Professor,
again grown serious, “is that you, who seem to so
thoroughly grasp and understand these evils, should
be willing to actively engage in their perpetuation.”</p>

<p>Before General Mainwarren could reply to this
home-thrust, the door opened and Colonel Cuming
reappeared.</p>

<p>“Can you imagine,” he exclaimed with evident excitement,
“the errand of the royal messenger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, to hurry Somebody on his journey, of course—before
we’ve had half a chance of enjoying his
society,” pouted Beatrice, who had followed the Colonel
into the room. “A summons to Court——”</p>

<p>“A summons to Court—that part is right,” interrupted
the Colonel, “but you haven’t guessed
rightly as to whom. The message is this: ‘His Majesty
commands Colonel Sir Maynard Cuming to repair
at once to Court and to bring with him his notable
guests, Professor Walter Stuart Dean and Mr.
Thomas Kearns, the details concerning whose remarkable
experiences His Majesty has learned with much
interest.’ What do you say to that?”</p>

<p>Both the Professor and Kearns stood agape with
astonishment. Beatrice’s voice was the first to break
the silence.</p>

<p>“And do I go, too, papa?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear—if you wish.”</p>

<p>“If I wish! Well, yes; I decidedly do. Just
think of the fun of going to Court and seeing cousin
Dorothy. My cousin, Dorothy,” she added, as an explanatory
interjection for the benefit of the Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and Kearns, “is one of the maids of honor to the
Queen.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added General Mainwarren, “and she is
as popular at the Court as she is beautiful, which in
this case is saying much.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear,” exclaimed the Colonel wistfully,
“you haven’t seen Dorothy since you were quite a
little girl. I fear you may find things somewhat
changed. Dorothy may not be inclined to devote so
much attention to my little country bud as in the old
days.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Beatrice with enthusiasm, “I am convinced
Dorothy will never change toward me. She’s
not that kind. When do we start?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow! Oh, how shall I ever be able to get
ready! I must be off to look after things. I hope
I shan’t appear before the Court and Dorothy quite
like a dowdy!” And she pirouetted out of the room.</p>

<p>“Forgive her, gentlemen,” said the Colonel indulgently,
“she’s only a child yet, you know. But,
tell me what you think of this news I bring.”</p>

<p>“Think!” replied the Professor; “what are we to
think. It’s impossible to imagine what we can be
needed for—except, perhaps, as curiosities. I’m
quite unfamiliar with the atmosphere of a Court and
I think I may truthfully say that my friend Kearns
is equally so. I don’t know whether we should go.”</p>

<p>“And I think I may truthfully say,” declared
Kearns, with a laugh, “that I have had an extensive
experience with courts, though not of this precise
character. Still, like the Professor, I am in doubt
as to whether we ought to go. I’ve no particular liking
for figuring as a curiosity.”</p>

<p>“It would never do to refuse the royal command,”
said the Colonel. “Oh, by the way, there is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
I had nearly forgotten. His Majesty has especially
inquired as to the health of Mr. Kearns and
will receive him in special audience immediately
after his arrival at the Court.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” exclaimed the Professor with light
sarcasm, “let me congratulate you, my friend. You
seem to be basking in the sunshine of royal favor.”</p>

<p>But Kearns sat with bent brows, apparently in
deep thought. A moment later he sprang lightly to
his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he exclaimed with determination, “we’ll
go. I’ve been there before, you know.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked the Professor. “To the
Court?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Kearns grimly, “not to the
Court, but I’ve had experiences of this kind before.
In the old days there were lots of times when the rich
and the grand solicitously inquired as to the health of
Mr. Thomas Kearns and were graciously pleased—it
used to be ‘exceedingly pleased’ or ‘eagerly anxious’
in those days—to receive him in special audience.
My experience tells me that when the rich and
the great and the mighty are suddenly seized with a
vivid interest in my health, joined to an anxiety to
see me in special audience, it is safe to gamble there
are special reasons therefor. In the classic language
of my day: ‘There is something doing’—some
cash, or jewels, or maybe a lady gone astray and
Thomas Kearns is needed to fix the difficulty, or solve
the puzzle.”</p>

<p>“You think,” said the Professor, “that——”</p>

<p>“That there is some trouble at Court, or some danger
which threatens the King upon his throne,” said
Kearns with conviction.</p>

<p>“I shall not be astonished if you were right,” said
General Mainwarren slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>The rest of the day was spent in preparations for
the departure. Not least amongst these preparations
was the selection for the Professor and Kearns, of
a wardrobe which would modernize them in dress, at
least. Some further instruction as to the changes
which had taken place and as to the methods and
manners of the Court were also given, with General
Mainwarren and the Colonel as instructors. Interspersed
with matters of Court etiquette, they learned
the details of the great war recently so successfully
closed between Russia and the Allies—the United
States and Great Britain—in which, after many
fierce struggles and an invasion resembling in many
details that of the great Napoleon, the power of the
fierce, barbaric Colossus of the North had finally
been crushed.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening, Beatrice, full of life and
spirits, was in joyous anticipation of the journey before
them. Her prattle kept the party in merry
mood, all except General Mainwarren, who seemed
somewhat thoughtful and preoccupied.</p>

<p>“We will enjoy our coffee and cigars in the music
room,” said the Colonel to the Professor and Kearns,
when dinner was over. “You shall indulge in a treat
that was unattainable in your times.”</p>

<p>He led the way to a spacious apartment adjoining
the library—an apartment from walls of which protruded
a number of giant-like trumpets.</p>

<p>“There,” said the Colonel, pointing to two of the
larger instruments, “we have direct connection with
the Haymarket Theatre, in London, and also with the
Covent Garden Theatre. Those other two instruments
connect with two opera houses in Paris. I cannot
treat you to English, or to French opera. Owing to
the difference in time, neither of these cities is in
action at its theatres at this moment. I can, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
let you hear some of the leading attractions in
New York.”</p>

<p>“Yon mean to say,” exclaimed the Professor with
rapt interest, “that you are practically in telephonic
communication with the principal cities of the
world?”</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” answered the Colonel modestly,
“since my music room is not large enough to permit
of it, but it could be done. As it is, I am in touch
with London, Paris, and several of the principal cities
in this country. Now, listen to this. I am going to
connect with the Folly Theatre, in New York. They
have a revival on there of an old operetta; quite a
favorite, I believe, in your time.”</p>

<p>“What is its name?” asked Kearns.</p>

<p>“Dolly Varden,” replied the Colonel effusively;
“Dolly Varden, the title rôle of which, if I recall
aright, was created by that charming <i>artiste</i> of your
day, Glaser—the glorious Glaser, whose name has
come down to us as the queen of comedy of the Western
world.”</p>

<p>As the Colonel finished speaking, he turned a rubber-covered
knob in the wall beside one of the instruments
and instantly there floated through the room
the strains of “The Lay of the Jay,” from Edwards’
captivating operetta. Sweetly and clearly music and
words floated into the room:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Once there was a jay-bird; a rather ancient jay-bird,</div>
<div class="indent3">Who lived on the top of a tree.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>As the song ended, Kearns and the Professor were
visibly affected.</p>

<p>The minutes passed. Still they listened, entranced,
until the close of the opera. Then came the
sounds of a moving multitude, joined to the playing
of the band.</p>

<p>“The audience is leaving,” remarked the Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
regretfully, “and the orchestra is playing the air
‘My Country ’Tis of Thee.’ Thank God! You have,
at least, retained that old, familiar song.”</p>

<p>“You mistake!” said General Mainwarren
solemnly. “It is no longer known by that name.”</p>

<p>“What, then?” gasped the Professor.</p>

<p>“God Save our Gracious King!” said the General.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>A MYSTERY OF THE PALACE</small></h3>
</div>

<p>The antechamber of the King, in the great Summer
Palace on the hill, was crowded with officers
of the Army and Navy, financiers and statesmen,
diplomats and courtiers. The officers and the diplomats
wore the uniforms of their respective services.
The rest were clad in court costume, consisting of
knee-breeches and tunic, strongly suggesting the court
dress of the times of Louis XVI. It is said that fashions,
like history, repeat themselves and here was a
reversion to the models of the gay French court in
the days of the Bourbons. With the splendor of color
and the glittering crosses and orders upon the breasts
of the men, the scene was a brilliant one.</p>

<p>A gorgeously attired attendant stood at the door
leading into the inner audience chamber. At intervals
someone who had been received in audience
would pass out and the attendant, in a loud voice,
would call a name and the favored one would pass to
the audience chamber.</p>

<p>“General Mainwarren!” called the attendant,
presently, and the General, leaving the side of Colonel
Cuming, advanced and passed in.</p>

<p>The audience accorded the General was not prolonged.
In a short time he returned to the antechamber.
There was a slight flush upon his face and
his mouth was set in a determined line.</p>

<p>“How did matters pass off?” inquired the Colonel
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Nothing decisive,” replied General Mainwarren.
“I am commanded to remain at Court pending further
discussion. I had, though, a rather sharp passage
of arms with Milord Ashley.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Sir Maynard Cuming and party!” the
attendant at that moment announced; and the Colonel,
followed by the Professor and Kearns, entered
the audience chamber.</p>

<p>The King was seated in a massive chair of magnificently
carved oak, beside a portentous-looking table,
littered with documents of state and other papers tied
together with pink or blue silk ribbon. As he sat
there, he presented the appearance of a man slightly
above the middle height, slight of figure and thin of
face, with keen, bright blue eyes, a long and luxuriant
brown moustache and short, closely clipped, lighter-brown
beard. The face, deeply marked with lines of
thought and care, showed keen perception and sharp
intuition. His movements were quick and nervous.
There was one noticeable mannerism. The face had
a peculiar aptitude for breaking into a smile which at
its moment of origin was bright and cheery and, so
lasting for a moment, suddenly died away into a fixed,
cold stare. It was as a gleam of sunshine, followed
by frost. He was garbed in the dress of the Court
and upon his breast glittered a single order.</p>

<p>Beside and slightly behind him stood Lord Cyril
Ashley, Vice-Chancellor of the Empire and Master
of the Imperial Household. Lord Ashley was a well-preserved
man of middle age; tall, handsome, and
of soldierly bearing. The face, with its dark eyes,
strongly marked brows and sweeping black moustache,
was that of a man of stern will and strong
determination. He was dressed in the dashing uniform
of a Captain of the Guards.</p>

<p>Colonel Cuming advanced, bowing low before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
King, followed by his two companions. The Colonel
was received by His Majesty with marked cordiality
and at the royal invitation he presented the Professor
and Kearns. As the latter was presented, the King
turned upon him a sharp, scrutinizing glance.</p>

<p>His Majesty listened to the story of the resurrection
of the two wayfarers from the past with an air
of marked interest and after asking a number of questions
signified that the interview was at an end.
But it was the royal wish that Mr. Thomas Kearns
should remain in special audience.</p>

<p>Colonel Cuming and the Professor accordingly
backed out of the royal presence, leaving Kearns
somewhat astonished and perplexed amid his novel
surroundings.</p>

<p>“History records, Mr. Kearns,” said the King,
“that you were the most skilful and the most successful
Chief of Secret Service this country has ever
known. Is not that correct, Milord?” he asked,
turning to Lord Ashley.</p>

<p>“It is so recorded, Sire,” answered the Vice-Chancellor.
“Our historians and our writers of fiction
have alike presented to us Mr. Kearns as the great
Chief of Secret Service of the Western world—the
equal of Vidocq, or of Fouché, if not their superior.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said the King; “and it is precisely a
Fouché that we need at our court at the present
time. Your old-time cunning is, doubtless, still with
you?”</p>

<p>Kearns bowed somewhat awkwardly.</p>

<p>“I do not know, Sire,” he answered simply.</p>

<p>He had heard both Colonel Cuming and Lord Ashley
address the King as “Sire,” and he thought it
best to follow this form.</p>

<p>“How so—you do not know?” inquired the King.</p>

<p>“Well, Sire,” replied Kearns, “as such talents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
as I once had have not had a chance of being exercised
during seventy-five years, they may have become
somewhat rusty. Besides, your writers have, perhaps,
taken liberties and have exaggerated somewhat.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the King, his face breaking into
a pleasant smile; “the modesty of genius!” The
smile faded suddenly into that peculiar frosty stare,
and he continued: “We have, however, less need for
modesty than for action. Do you feel your abilities
impaired?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Sire,” came the quick answer.
“I feel as well as ever I did in my life.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” retorted the King, “should you
question your ability? Is it not true that upon one
occasion you detected the writer of certain letters
from among a whole cityful of people?”</p>

<p>“I had so many cases in my time, Sire,” answered
Kearns, with some hesitancy, “that I scarcely recollect
the particular case you seem to have in mind.
My memory has grown a little faint after this lapse
of time. If you could give me a few details as to
the circumstances——”</p>

<p>“The circumstances,” exclaimed the King, “were,
as we remember them, as follows: An ancestor of
one of our most distinguished subjects—Baron
Gold—had been the recipient of a number of letters,
written by some unknown writer, threatening him
with assassination. He sent to you for aid in his
peril and, it is recorded, within forty-eight hours,
by a most ingenious plan, you had detected and apprehended
the malefactor. Is this true?”</p>

<p>Kearns with difficulty restrained himself from
laughing outright. Well he remembered the case
now and the shrewd face of the ancestor of the distinguished
Baron Gold rose with startling vividness
before his mental vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Quite true, Sire,” he answered gravely; “but the
case was a rather simple one.”</p>

<p>“A rather simple one! We would have you tell
us how you accomplished these things.”</p>

<p>“In this way, Sire,” replied Kearns. “As you
have said, our friend—that is, I should say, the—ah—distinguished
ancestor of the distinguished
Baron Gold had been in receipt of letters threatening
him with death, unless he paid a certain money
tribute. He was a man of wealth—of very great
wealth—but he had a constitutional aversion to parting
with it. Almost equally he disliked the possibility
of sudden death.”</p>

<p>Again the King smiled his peculiar smile of mingled
sunshine and frost.</p>

<p>“How the characteristics of the ancestor are carried
down through the generations!” he remarked to
Lord Ashley.</p>

<p>The latter smiled and bowed a respectful acquiescence.</p>

<p>“Proceed!” said the King.</p>

<p>“Brought face to face with these two almost equally
disagreeable alternatives,” continued Kearns, “he
sent for me. Investigation quickly showed me that all
the letters had been mailed within a certain radius
in the city. I caused such action to be taken by
the ancestor of Baron Gold as was likely to lead to
an early reply from the unknown letter writer. Then
I proceeded to throw out my net. I caused every
drop box in the post offices and every pillar box in
the streets within the suspected district to be watched
by two persons—the one an employe of the Post
Office, the other one of my men. The moment a
letter was dropped, the Post Office employe would
proceed to examine the address on such letter. If it
was not addressed to the threatened person, a rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
band was twisted over the envelope to distinguish it
from anything dropped later. In this way the Post
Office man was readily enabled to distinguish all the
examined letters from the latest one dropped.</p>

<p>“This method,” pursued Kearns, “was continued
systematically for a day and a night without yielding
any result. On the afternoon of the second day,
however, a man approached a letter box in one of
the side streets, deposited a letter and hastily walked
away. The Post Office employe stepped to the box,
opened it as usual and—up went his hand above
his head. This was the agreed signal. In an instant
my man was after the depositor of the letter and
had him in custody. He was brought before me and
the letter, opened in his presence by—ah—the ancestor
of Baron Gold, contained conclusive proof of
his guilt. The man turned out to be a monomaniac,
hence his peculiar cunning and the difficulty experienced
in catching him in any of the ordinary traps
usually laid in such cases. But, you see, after all,
the case was simple enough.”</p>

<p>“It was highly ingenious,” decided the King.
“It is recorded also that out of a band of men you
picked a murderer by an examination of the hands
of these men. Is this so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sire,” answered Kearns; “that’s quite correct.
The case was a more difficult one. The circumstances
were somewhat repellant.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, we would learn them,” said the
King.</p>

<p>“A woman had been murdered by one of that species
of fiends, half criminal, half madman, who spring
up from time to time. The murderer in this case,
after killing his victim, had torn away certain portions
of the body. In the course of his devilish
work, he had cut into and mutilated a portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
intestines. My investigations discovered that a short
time before the murder the woman had eaten a certain
kind of food. From other circumstances learned
by me I was convinced that one of a certain number
of men had slain her. I had these men brought before
me and caused the lodgments under their finger-nails
to be carefully scraped and preserved in separate
packages. A scientific examination of the contents
of one package disclosed the presence of human blood
corpuscles, together with certain minute particles,
the chemical resultants of that particular food of
which the woman had partaken shortly before her
death. In a word, I had the murderer.”</p>

<p>“Skilful, decidedly skilful,” commented the King.
“It is precisely for such skill that we have urgent
need at the present time.”</p>

<p>“In what direction, Sire?”</p>

<p>“Here—at our Court. We have decided to retain
you in our service and we count upon your
fidelity and the exercise of your uttermost skill.”</p>

<p>Kearns bowed. The ancestor of the distinguished
Baron Gold and the numerous other great men who
had been wont to invoke his services in the olden
time had adopted a tone of supplication rather than
of patronage. However, he accepted the change as
part and parcel of the new order of things and Mr.
Thomas Kearns was a man to adapt himself to any
and all existing circumstances.</p>

<p>“Listen, then,” said the King. “For some time
past our peace has been disturbed—nay, the safety
of our very person threatened—from some unknown
source which all the energy of our Secret Service
has been unable to discover. We look to you to discover
that source—to run to earth these arch-enemies
of our peace and safety.”</p>

<p>“Will you furnish me with further details, Sire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“It was some months ago,” continued the King,
“when we awoke one morning to find a paper on
the table beside our bed. It is needless to recount
what this paper contained. Suffice that it held demands
and threats. You will realize the importance
of this happening, for he who had the power to
deposit that paper had also the power to have inflicted
more material injury.”</p>

<p>Kearns bowed his assent.</p>

<p>“Our sleeping apartment,” resumed the King, “is
some fifty feet from the ground. There are sentinels
on the roof of the palace and in the grounds
below. The sentinels were trebled and other precautions
taken and yet again this occurrence came to
pass.”</p>

<p>“Another document,” questioned Kearns, “of the
same character, deposited under the same circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said the King, and a perceptible shiver
passed over him; “but yet stranger things were
to happen. Extraordinary precautions were now
taken. The surroundings of the room were filled
with sentinels, men were posted in the corridors, an
officer of the guard stationed in the antechamber. At
our side slept our faithful mastiff, Victor—a noble
brute, of great sagacity and strength. The doors
leading into our apartment were sealed from the
inside by our own hand, so that no movement of
these doors could be made without disturbing these
seals. Were these not precautions enough?”</p>

<p>“The value of a precaution is best tested by its
efficacy, Sire,” replied Kearns cautiously.</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed the King, “these precautions
were without value, for one night, some four weeks
ago, there was another visitation.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Sire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Our repose had lasted some two hours when we
were sharply awakened by the furious barking of the
dog, followed by his savage growls. His head was
bent to the ground and he savagely clutched something
between his teeth. Nothing in the apartment was disturbed;
nothing beyond the actions of the animal
was to be noted; the seals on the doors were undisturbed.
And yet—between the teeth of the dog
was a document, folded and tied together. It contained
the same demands, repeated the same threats.
With an apartment fifty feet above the ground, armed
sentinels filling every avenue, the doors fastened by
seals, how did it get there—how did it get there!”
cried the King with agitation.</p>

<p>“The possibility of a trap door in floor or ceiling,
or of a secret entrance of any kind to the chamber
is not to be entertained, of course?” asked Kearns.</p>

<p>“Not for a moment!” exclaimed the King. “You
may pass that by as not needing further consideration.
Eh, Milord Ashley?”</p>

<p>“Oh, undoubtedly!” answered the Master of the
Household. “The apartment has been thoroughly
examined from every side. Any secret means of ingress
through floor, walls or ceiling is absolutely
impossible.”</p>

<p>“But there are chimneys—windows?”</p>

<p>“Chimneys, no,” replied Lord Ashley. “We
warm to-day by electricity and there isn’t a chimney
in the whole palace. As to windows, yes; there are
four.”</p>

<p>“Were they shuttered, or screened?”</p>

<p>“Screened?” exclaimed Lord Ashley with bewilderment.
“How do you mean—screened?”</p>

<p>“Why,” answered Kearns, equally astonished at
this observation, “I mean, of course, screened against
flies—mosquitoes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Flies—mosquitoes!” exclaimed the King and
Lord Ashley in the same breath. Both gave a hearty
guffaw.</p>

<p>Kearns was visibly nettled. This was, indeed, different
from the old days. He was certainly not accustomed
to being laughed at. The last time this
had occurred was when he had been outwitted upon
one occasion by Converse, the so-called King of Counterfeiters—an
experienced, clever and wily old
wrongdoer. Kearns never forgave that laugh, and it
was not long until Converse, in spite of his great
ability, fell into an especially clever net set by Kearns.
Incidentally, he paid the penalty of that laugh with
a twenty years’ sentence. It was not a healthy occupation
to laugh at Mr. Kearns in those days.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley noticed Kearns’ very evident chagrin.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he hastened to explain; “thanks to our
modern scientists we have no flies or—ah—mosquitoes
in these days. They are unknown to-day
except as curiosities in the collection of some scientist,
or under the glass cases in our museums. It is
quite natural,” he added, with a conciliatory wave
of the hand, “that you should have—ah—overlooked
this fact.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Kearns’ chagrin was not to be so easily
dissipated.</p>

<p>“Conditions have doubtless changed,” he said
somewhat testily, “and I see nothing to be gained
by any desultory examination of the facts. It will
be necessary for me to make a personal investigation
of the surroundings themselves.”</p>

<p>“Every facility shall be accorded you,” said the
King. “Quarters shall be assigned you in the palace.
Do you think,” he inquired anxiously, “that
you will succeed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“I’m not accustomed to failure, Sire,” answered
Kearns almost curtly.</p>

<p>“Succeed, then,” exclaimed the King, “and the
reward which shall be yours shall be such as to emphasize
the distinction between the liberality of a
Court and the proverbial ingratitude of Republics.”</p>

<p>Kearns bowed.</p>

<p>“I can undertake to prosecute this investigation
successfully,” he said, “under one condition only.”</p>

<p>“It is?” asked the King.</p>

<p>“I’ve been accustomed, Sire,” said Kearns with
dignity, “to pursue certain methods peculiarly my
own. Those methods I must continue if I am to be
successful. You’ve doubtless had people at work
on this case. They must be called off. In a word,
I must not be interfered with. I must have sole
and entire charge.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you should need assistance?”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll ask for it. Also, I reserve the right
to select my assistants.”</p>

<p>Both the King and Lord Ashley seemed to hesitate.
At last the King spoke.</p>

<p>“Those so far employed have failed,” he said.
“It shall be as you ask.”</p>

<p>“Then, Sire,” said Kearns, “I’ve but one other
request to make.”</p>

<p>“Name it,” said the King.</p>

<p>“That my companion, Professor Dean, be permitted
to remain.”</p>

<p>“A most natural desire,” exclaimed the King.
“Our Master of the Household will issue such orders
as will insure every facility to you and every comfort
to you both. You will attend the Court ball
to-night; it will afford you opportunities of observation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>His Majesty signified that the audience was at an
end and Mr. Kearns withdrew.</p>

<p>“Professor,” said Kearns, after they had been
conducted to the quarters assigned them in the palace,
“didn’t I predict that there were special reasons
why we should be welcomed here? With our services
in demand and with the freedom of the Imperial
Palace, we don’t seem to be doing so badly for wayfarers
in a strange land.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said the Professor. “There is
some danger, then, threatening the King?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Serious?”</p>

<p>“From what I can judge of the case thus far,”
said Mr. Kearns thoughtfully, “I should say yes!
Serious—<i>quite serious</i>!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE GREAT COURT BALL</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“I will point out some of the notables,” said General
Mainwarren to the Professor and Kearns; “they
will no doubt interest you, especially such as are
descendants of those known to you in your time.”</p>

<p>The scene was the great Court ball, held in the
magnificent <i>salons</i> of the Summer Palace, ablaze
with light and beauty. The sumptuous decorations,
the masses of flowers, the resplendent uniforms, the
glittering crosses and orders upon the breasts of
many of the men, the Court dresses, the blaze of jewels—composed
a scene of the utmost brilliancy and
splendor.</p>

<p>And the women! American women have ever
been famed for their grace, their ineffable <i>chic</i> and
their beauty, and certainly the race, as viewed from
this ball-room floor, seemed by no means to have declined.
Kearns, who had been a regular attendant
at the opera in the old days, considered himself quite
a judge of feminine loveliness. He remembered to
have heard it urged by captious foreigners that the
American woman’s weakest points were her walk and
her voice. These defects seemed to have received
attention, for in the noble bearing of the heads of
these women, the graceful sweep of their walk, their
sweet vocal intonations, there was no ground left for
the most captious critic to stand upon. Decidedly,
thought Kearns, both the walk and the voice had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
cultivated to perfection under the <i>regime</i> of royalty.</p>

<p>“The notables,” he said in answer to General
Mainwarren’s words. “Ah, yes! By the way,” he
added with sudden animation, “could you point out
to me the—the—distinguished Baron Gold.”</p>

<p>“Baron Gold—Baron Gold,” repeated General
Mainwarren, “let me see if I can discover him for
you.”</p>

<p>He glanced about the ball-room.</p>

<p>“There he is!” he exclaimed, after a brief search.</p>

<p>Kearns and the Professor followed the direction
of the General’s glance and saw an old man, with
gray eyes, sunken cheeks and high forehead, engaged
in conversation with a white-moustached gentleman,
in the uniform of the diplomatic corps, who sat at
his side.</p>

<p>“So that is Baron Gold?” said Kearns.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered General Mainwarren, “that is
Baron Gold, one of the great Trust magnates and
at one time Chancellor of the Exchequer. His country
seat is Gorgan Court and his arms are an eagle
with beak elevated and talons outspread, and the
motto: ‘I dare and I do.’ That’s correct, I believe,
Colonel?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” answered Colonel Cuming.</p>

<p>“‘I dare and I do,’ eh?” said Kearns reflectively.
“Very appropriate!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed General Mainwarren, “see the
party passing opposite to us. He with the white
hair, slightly in advance of the rest, with the Star of
the Empire upon his breast, is His Grace, the Duke
of Marquanna, Chancellor of the Realm, often styled
the American ‘Warwick,’ since he lent such powerful
hand in the establishment and formation of the Empire.
He takes his title from his beautiful country
seat, bearing the family name of Marquanna. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
arms are a gerfalcon, rising over an argent field, with
the motto: ‘Gold is tried by Fire, but Men are tried
by Gold.’”</p>

<p>“An excellent motto, too!” commented Kearns.
“‘Men are tried by gold!’ eh? Well; the handsome
and able ancestor of this particular Duke could
certainly have left behind some striking illustrations
of that fact had he been pleased to do so.”</p>

<p>“The Duke,” continued General Mainwarren, “is
growing somewhat old and infirm and, while he
yields not one jot of his power and authority, certain
of the more arduous routine duties of his office of
Chancellor he delegates to the Vice-Chancellor, Lord
Ashley, who is there on his left hand. You are
already acquainted with him.”</p>

<p>“What manner of man is Lord Ashley?” questioned
Kearns. “He interests me.”</p>

<p>“Lord Ashley, Vice-Chancellor and Master of the
Imperial Household,” replied General Mainwarren,
“is a soldier who earned a reputation for daring and
dash during the early part of the late war with Russia.
He was severely wounded at the battle of
Pedrofski and retired during the rest of the campaign.
His actual military rank is Captain of the
Imperial Guards—a position which carries with it
the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.”</p>

<p>“Who are these Guards?” asked Kearns.</p>

<p>“They are His Majesty’s body-guard, and consist
of three regiments,” said the General. “They are
attached to the different imperial palaces. The men
are all picked for their splendid physique, and the
uniforms are magnificent.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” assented Kearns, his eyes still following
the Duke of Marquanna’s party. “And who are
the four persons behind the Duke?”</p>

<p>“The taller one of the first two,” answered General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Mainwarren, “is the Earl of Vandergilt, one of
the heads of the great Transportation Trust, and the
smaller, stouter man at his side, with the white side
whiskers, the rubicund countenance and nose like the
beak of the eagle is Sir Mancey Carew, a great legal
light, raconteur, and right-hand man of the Earl.
See how his eyes twinkle and his lips purse; he is
about to tell a story!”</p>

<p>“And the other two?”</p>

<p>“The nearest one to us,” answered General Mainwarren,
“is Sir Keypoint Horgan; the person at his
side I do not know. Do you, Colonel?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Colonel Cuming. “He’s a comparative
new-comer at the Court. He’s an Englishman,
with important financial interests here. Failing
to attain distinction in his native land, it is said,
he decided to become a naturalized American subject.
The King has recently created him a Baronet and
he now rejoices in the title of Sir Walder-Asta.”</p>

<p>“There seem to be many notables present,” remarked
Kearns.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied General Mainwarren. “The nobility
from all parts of the land are here. See the
group over there to our right. There is Sir Marlington
Blackhouse, the famous cotillon leader, and
Lady Terry Montbel and Lady Olive Harrifellow,
each noted as a beauty and a sportswoman; Sir Hatmeadow-Hatmeadow
Nailer, Lady Phillippe Shield
and Lady Dotter Dalmer, all three from the middle
country; Sir Charles De Olde, from the West, and
Lady Jacques Jardinier, from the city which, I believe,
you were wont to term the ‘Athens of America.’”</p>

<p>Further conversation was temporarily interrupted
by a stir, a buzz and a general rising as the King and
Queen, accompanied by their suites, made their entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and crossed the floor to a raised dais at the
further end of the ball-room where two magnificently
draped throne chairs were reserved for them. The
band burst forth with the National Anthem, once
known as “My Country, ’Tis of Thee,” now styled
“God Save the King.” The King and Queen took
their seats and the ball was resumed.</p>

<p>In appearance the Queen was tall and slight of
figure almost to the point of girlishness, with pale,
regular features and well-poised head. The face reflected
an amiable disposition, joined to a certain
pride and determination, but it suggested more of
sorrow and resignation than of contentment and happiness.
As she sat under the full light of the
brilliant ball-room, her regal jewels a-glitter, her
noble profile sharply outlined, she looked graceful,
beautiful, every inch a queen, yet unhappy.</p>

<p>The Professor and Kearns gazed upon her with
mingled admiration and interest.</p>

<p>“The Queen,” whispered the latter to General
Mainwarren; “what of her?”</p>

<p>“Is she not gracious and beautiful!” answered
the General in lowered tones. “Who is she? She
was, before her marriage to the King, an Archduchess
of Austria—the youngest daughter of the Austrian
monarch.”</p>

<p>“She is popular and happy?”</p>

<p>“Popular, yes—with her sweet and gracious
ways she has crept into the hearts of the people and
for that reason is regarded by many as one of the
strongest bulwarks of the throne. But happy; alas,
no!”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Never did any mediæval monarch cling more
strongly to the maxim that ‘The King can do no
wrong,’ or more fully demand the liberties and immunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
claimed by kingcraft, than this King who
sits upon the American throne. His profligacy and
licentiousness, his all too many and too flagrant intrigues,
have deeply shocked the Queen, who is
naturally possessed of strong religious and moral
sentiments. There is an estrangement of long standing
between them. They are together only when
some public function demands and she maintains a
surrounding of her own, entirely apart from the
King’s, devoting her attention largely to the education
of the two young princes. Ah, there is little
Beatrice!”</p>

<p>All looked as General Mainwarren spoke and saw
approaching in their direction Beatrice Cuming in
company with four other ladies. The members of
the party seated themselves a slight distance away.</p>

<p>“Who is that beautiful girl taking her place beside
your daughter?” asked the Professor of Colonel
Cuming.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Kearns explosively; “so the
man of science has an eye for feminine beauty, eh!
Look out, Professor, that in spite of your hundred
odd years, you don’t get enmeshed. Let me see this
beauty. Whew! But the man is right. Beautiful!
Why, she’s a dream—a lovely dream! What
eyes—what teeth!”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” repeated the Professor.</p>

<p>“That,” answered Colonel Cuming, “is the lady
to whom you heard Beatrice refer—Miss Dorothy
Brandon, a distant cousin of Beatrice and one of the
maids of honor to Her Majesty, the Queen.”</p>

<p>“And are the other three ladies also maids of
honor?” asked Kearns, with a sly glance at General
Mainwarren.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the General, smiling; “not exactly
maids of honor, although each holds position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
at the Court. The tall brunette, with the bold dark
eyes, and the tiara of diamonds flashing above her
dark hair, is the Countess Brooke, one of the most
handsome women and, I might perhaps add, credited
with being one of the most dangerous intrigantes
of the Court. She has a clever and a dangerous
tongue and is sometimes styled ‘the Babbling
Brooke,’ after a certain famous beauty of one of the
old-time English Courts, whom this lady in many
respects strongly resembles. You see, history repeats
itself.”</p>

<p>“And the other two ladies?”</p>

<p>“The shorter brunette, with the heavy dark brows,
the brilliant red lips and the big brown eyes is the
Baroness Maquehaye, a great leader of fashion and
a wonderful entertainer. Her garden-party of last
Spring is still talked about. The tall, rather plump
blonde lady, on the other side of the Countess, is
Lady Hadley-Barton, famed for her social ambitions.
Ah, I see there is going to be an addition to the
party.”</p>

<p>As the General spoke two army officers, each clad
in the dashing uniform of the Imperial Guard, advanced
and greeted the ladies. One of them was a
man of magnificent physique, tall, and lithe, with
clear, flashing blue eyes and a sweeping blond moustache;
the other was shorter, dark, with kindly brown
eyes and of sinewy, well-knit figure.</p>

<p>“A pair of remarkably clean-cut, fine-looking
men,” commented Kearns, “although I have no doubt
that uniform helps matters along a good deal. Who
are they?”</p>

<p>“You see in them,” answered General Mainwarren,
“two of the bravest and most dashing young
officers of the army. Both of them performed deeds
of daring in the late war with Russia which made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
their names ring throughout the country and made
them the objects of the usual popular idolatry which
the American people have ever been wont to lavish,
for a short time at least, upon their heroes. See that
peculiar-shaped star which each wears among the
decorations on his breast. It’s the Star of Columbia,
the most coveted decoration of all the many decorations
which this Court boasts. It’s the decoration
which is conferred only for special valor in actual
face of the enemy. Both these men wear it and both
have earned it. They’ve been recently ordered to
Court to join the Imperial Guard. Here they’re
show-pieces. Shame to it that gallant soldiers should
not be put to better uses! The taller of the two is
Captain Stanley Mortimer; the other, Captain Ralph
Swords.”</p>

<p>The two officers talked for some time in lively
strain with the ladies of the party, the brunt of the
conversation being borne by the Countess Brooke, who
leveled several witching glances at the tall guardsman.
Then Captain Mortimer offered his arm to
Dorothy and, followed by Captain Swords escorting
Beatrice, he led the way to the dancing-floor. From
the orchestra came the opening strains of a waltz.</p>

<p>Although the dancers were already taking their
positions upon the floor, Beatrice insisted upon stopping
as they passed her father’s party and, following
her usual impetuous methods, hurried general presentations
ensued. Miss Brandon smiled upon the
Professor and murmured a few pleasant words; and
Captain Mortimer extended a frank, soldierly invitation
to Kearns to visit him at his quarters next day.
Then the two couples passed on to mingle a moment
later in the maze of waltzers.</p>

<p>More bewitching grew the sensuous strains of the
waltz, faster and faster flew the steps of the dancers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
as Captain Stanley Mortimer, holding Dorothy
lightly clasped, circled the floor. He had caught
her step to a nicety and they whirled in perfect rhythmic
unison. Her breath was upon his cheek, a
loosened strand of her hair touched his lips, her form
nestled more closely in his arms. As the last bars
of the music died away, her eyes met his in one fleeting,
upward glance—half coy, half enraptured—and
he slowly bent his head in a motion that was
almost a caress.</p>

<p>But as they danced, a pair of black eyes, flashing
under heavy dark brows, had watched with unfriendly
glances, and the dainty lace handkerchief
between the jeweled fingers of the Countess Brooke
was defaced by two jagged rents.</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer led Dorothy back to her seat.</p>

<p>“The fourth waltz is to be mine?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“As you will,” she whispered back.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>IN THE GARDENS OF THE KING</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“They belonged to the Tenth Dragoons before
being transferred to the Imperial Guard?” asked the
Baroness Maquehaye.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Countess Brooke, “both Captain
Mortimer and Captain Swords belonged to the
Tenth and the Regiment was quartered at the Summer
Palace at Oldport. However, Lady Hadley-Barton
can tell us more about that, as she spent the
Summer at Oldport. I was there only toward the
close.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” exclaimed Lady Hadley-Barton effusively,
“and a delightful season we had, too! The
officers of the Tenth were simply too lovely. It was
one succession of receptions and balls and excursions
and coaching parties. Never had Oldport known
such a gay season as while the ‘Fighting Tenth’ was
there. They entertained us day and night. Really,
they took the place by storm and we surrendered ourselves
to them unconditionally.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” replied the Countess Brooke, with the
suspicion of a sneer in the slightly upraised eyebrow
and curve of the lip.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Lady Hadley-Barton, “never
was there a regiment—not even the Imperial Guard—which
contained so many handsome, dashing men
and such excellent entertainers. As I say, they captured
us completely. Of course, you will take me
figuratively.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“There was some little scandal, though, toward the
close of the season, if I remember rightly,” commented
Countess Brooke.</p>

<p>“Scandal?” questioned Baroness Maquehaye.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Countess Brooke, “in connection
with the high gaming in the mess-room of the Tenth.
Several young men, it’s said, were completely
ruined.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” exclaimed Lady Hadley-Barton, “it’s
true there was some gossip, but what of it? One
expects a little scandalizing whenever a company of
gay soldiers is on the ground. Of course, you will
take me figuratively.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem so astonishing to me,” remarked
Baroness Maquehaye, “that soldiers, especially after
a long and arduous campaign, should go in for heavy
gaming. The risks and chances of play must replace
with them to some extent the risks and chances of
war. What particular form of play did they indulge
in?”</p>

<p>“Baccarat,” answered Countess Brooke, “and the
bids for the bank, I understand, used to run up into
thousands of crowns. There was a bank bid in one
night under certain peculiar circumstances—circumstances
which will, no doubt, be long remembered by
the successful bidder, Captain Mortimer.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the name, Dorothy, who had
been engaged in conversation with Beatrice, slightly
turned her head. Every word that followed, in the
distinct, crisp tones of the Countess, fell clearly upon
her listening ear.</p>

<p>“Do tell us the story,” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye.
“It sounds as if it were likely to be interesting.”</p>

<p>“Quite a romance, although, perhaps, slightly sordid,”
continued the Countess Brooke carelessly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
“Well, it seems that on a particular night the play
was very heavy—unusually heavy even for the mess-room
of the Tenth. Captain Mortimer had been a
fairly good winner during the early part of the season,
but later encountered a long spell of ill-luck, which
often sets in with those who woo the fickle goddess
of chance. He had been losing heavily and in the
strong play of that night thought he saw a chance
to recoup. A bank was put up and under spirited
bidding went into the thousands.”</p>

<p>Here the Countess paused, with the dramatic
effect of a good <i>raconteuse</i>.</p>

<p>“Your story is quite interesting,” exclaimed
Baroness Maquehaye. “Do go on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; do,” added Lady Hadley-Barton, “I
love to hear of the wicked doings of those soldiers.
In fact, as I told Major Packenham, of the Tenth,
the wickeder the soldier the more I seem to worship
him.”</p>

<p>“I trust he took you—figuratively,” remarked
the Countess.</p>

<p>“Quite so; quite so,” Lady Hadley-Barton hastened
to respond.</p>

<p>“Pray proceed,” urged Baroness Maquehaye.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the Countess Brooke, “the bank
which had been bid up into the thousands was finally
awarded to the highest bidder—Captain Stanley
Mortimer.”</p>

<p>Dorothy Brandon stirred slightly in her seat and
her pink-and-white ear veered slightly around in the
direction of the narrator.</p>

<p>“The Captain threw down on the table the sum
representing the capital of the bank and took his
seat in the banker’s chair.”</p>

<p>Again the Countess paused, as if seeking to recall
the full details of her story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Yes, yes,” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye, “and
then——?”</p>

<p>“I can imagine the scene,” declared Lady Hadley-Barton
impulsively; “the green table, the stacks
of money, the high players. How I wish I had been
there. How much we women miss! I have so often
wished I wore trousers. Of course, you will take
me figuratively.”</p>

<p>“Captain Mortimer took his seat in the banker’s
chair,” resumed the Countess, “and as he did so
he looked upon those about him. ‘Gentlemen,’ he
said, ‘luck has been to me lately a sorry jade. Let’s
see if she will now mend her ways. If she doesn’t
and you succeed in breaking this bank, there’s nothing
left to me but to surrender the freedom and the
joys of happy bachelorhood, accept the offer which I
have of a command in the Imperial Guard, go to
Court and—marry an heiress. Now, gentlemen,
proceed and do your worst.’”</p>

<p>“How delightfully dramatic,” exclaimed Lady
Hadley-Barton.</p>

<p>“Well, and what happened next?” eagerly inquired
Baroness Maquehaye.</p>

<p>“Fortune favored the gallant Captain at one time
and it looked as if he might escape the dire fate of
having to sell his prized liberty to the God of Mammon,
as represented in the person of an heiress. But
the luck veered and set in heavily against the bank.
The right tableau won steadily; but the left—the
one nearest the banker’s heart, you will observe—did
the mischief. There came a heavy coup, both tableaux
winning, and the bank was broken.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye with tense
interest.</p>

<p>“The poor Captain!” remarked Lady Hadley-Barton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Captain Mortimer showed not the least perturbation,”
resumed Countess Brooke. “He rose from
the table, lighted a cigar and, turning to those about
him, said: ‘I congratulate you, gentlemen, but that
settles it for me. Now for the Court and—the
heiress!’”</p>

<p>“I call that an interesting story,” exclaimed Lady
Hadley-Barton. “Strange I hadn’t heard it before.”</p>

<p>“Interesting, perhaps, but decidedly mercenary,”
commented Baroness Maquehaye with some show of
disdain.</p>

<p>“Mercenary!” echoed Countess Brooke, “surely
you’re severe. Call it <i>un mariage de convenance</i>—or
of necessity, if you will—it sounds more pretty!
Isn’t the Captain a decidedly presentable man and
one famed for his bravery in the war? Won’t the
heiress who buys him with her gold secure her
money’s worth?”</p>

<p>A little man—dapper and smiling—dressed in
the uniform of the French diplomatic corps, the red
ribbon of the <i>Legion d’Honeur</i> at his buttonhole, presented
himself at that moment before Dorothy. To
his profound bow and extended arm she returned a
dazed stare. Her face was strangely strained and
pale. The little man was fairly taken aback.</p>

<p>“You promised me zis dance, you know, Mees
Brandon,” he stammered. “I am quite sure I have
not made mistake as to ze numbaire. I——”</p>

<p>Mechanically she arose, accepted the proferred arm
and went toward the dancing-floor.</p>

<p>“You are not indisposed, I trust,” he inquired
solicitously.</p>

<p>“Count D’Arville,” she exclaimed impulsively,
with a pressure ever so slight upon his gold-laced
sleeve, “I know how gallant are the gentlemen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
France and that you are <i>le plus galant des galants</i>.
You’ll do me a favor, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The Count’s face reddened in a pleasurable flush.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>mademoiselle</i>,” he exclaimed excitedly, and
almost losing command of his limited stock of English,
“if I shall do you a favor? It will give me
pleasure, as you know, to lay down ze life for you.
I await ze honor of your commands.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Count,” said Dorothy simply, her
blue eyes flashing upon him a grateful smile, “I
knew you would. I want you to forego this dance.
You won’t mind, will you?”</p>

<p>A look of disappointment came into Count D’Arville’s
face.</p>

<p>“It is a great deprivation, <i>mademoiselle</i>, but I am
your slave.”</p>

<p>“Instead,” continued Dorothy, “you will take me
to the conservatory.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And there you’ll leave me alone—entirely
alone—for a few moments, returning for me at the
end of the dance.”</p>

<p>“You are ill, <i>mademoiselle</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, no; I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Is there nothing I can do?”</p>

<p>Another light pressure on the Count’s resplendent
sleeve.</p>

<p>“Remember, <i>monsieur le comte</i>,” she said, “that
he who would serve well must yield blindly. You
wish to serve well?”</p>

<p>The speech was accompanied by another adroit
smile, before which the Count retired utterly
routed—horse, foot and dragoons.</p>

<p>“<i>Pardi! mademoiselle</i>,” he answered with effusion,
“to hear you is for me to obey. It shall be as
you will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He accordingly conducted her to the conservatory—an
immense structure of great length and
breadth, resembling more a miniature park than a
place ordinarily designated under the name of conservatory.
Here and there tropical trees and massive
plants stretched their foliage in wide, overhanging
branches; there were by-paths and niches and bowers
in the winding gardens; and at intervals fountains,
under whose limpid waters flashed golden fishes,
gushed forth amid the violets and the roses. It was
a dream of floral splendor—such opulence and magnificence
as had never been dreamed even by luxurious
Eastern potentates of the olden days. It was
the Western world saying to the Eastern: “You
bragged in the old days of your Oriental sumptuousness
and luxury, but yours was only a poor affair,
after all! See what we can do, with modern money
and modern methods!”</p>

<p>Into this great garden of the King, Count
D’Arville led Dorothy. He escorted her to a secluded
spot under the branches of a Taribou tree and
with numerous bows and protestations left her.</p>

<p>When, at the close of the dance a few minutes later,
he returned to her side, she rewarded him with a gracious
smile.</p>

<p>“You’ve been of great service to me, <i>monsieur le
comte</i>,” she said. “Now, please take me back. I
am engaged for the next waltz—the fourth, you
know. Ah, I have one other service to ask of you!”</p>

<p>“It is, <i>mademoiselle</i>?”</p>

<p>“The dance after that—after the fourth waltz, I
mean—I have promised to Lord Ashley. Will you
kindly tell Lord Ashley that he will find me in the
conservatory—at this spot?”</p>

<p>Count D’Arville bowed.</p>

<p>“I will bear your commands to Milord Ashley,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
he said, “but after zat—later on—may I not have
my lost dance?”</p>

<p>A weary look came into her face.</p>

<p>“After that—after Lord Ashley—I’ll dance no
more to-night,” she said. “But,” she hastened to
add, “I’ll make it up to you. At the ball next
week you shall have two.”</p>

<p>Quite elated with this promise, the gallant Count
reluctantly surrendered her to her partner for the
fourth waltz, Captain Stanley Mortimer.</p>

<p>Again he held her in his arms, as he skilfully
guided her amid the whirling dancers; again he felt
her breath upon his cheek; again her upturned eyes
met his—smiling, ecstatic, dreamy—and into their
depths he looked with tenderness. He was vaguely
conscious of her warm and yielding form pressed to
his; of the rise and fall of her firm, white bosom and
throat; of a strange, rare perfume, that seemed to
exhale from her dress, from amid the glittering gold
of her hair, intoxicating him.</p>

<p>His heart beating wildly, his whole being filling,
thrilling, with a wild ecstasy of hope and of love, on
and on they danced until the last bars of the waltz
had been played out and the dance came to an end.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood silent. Then, with a
murmured suggestion as to the warmth of the ball-room,
he led her to the conservatory. Slowly they
wandered along the winding paths until—unconsciously
as it seemed—they reached a secluded seat
under the outstretched branches of a wide-leafed
Taribou tree.</p>

<p>For some moments they sat there—speechless,
almost motionless. A great wave of emotion surged
within him. Never in the wildest charges into the
gray-coated Russian ranks, nor in the bloody night
attack upon Varshava, nor when he had spiked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
great gun on the heights of Vladivik, had his heart
beat so wildly. He longed to speak and yet a species
of dread—a coward fear—overawed him.</p>

<p>With an effort, he drew himself together and turned
to her. She raised her eyes to his. Then the pent-up
words suddenly rushed to his lips and in a mad,
wild torrent of eloquence and love he poured forth
to her the hope of his soul.</p>

<p>With his first words her eyes sank and with
drooped head she listened, without sign or movement,
to the very end. Then, as with hope and
doubt—doubt and hope—tearing at his heart, he
waited one breathless moment, she slowly rose to her
feet and turned her eyes full upon his face. He
caught a light in them which brought him, staggering,
to his feet. He faced her with straining eyes and
features tense and rigid—as a man awaiting his
death blow. As last she spoke:</p>

<p>“You certainly play the part well, Captain Mortimer—so
well one might almost believe it true.
Really, I congratulate you.”</p>

<p>“Play—a part! What can you mean?”</p>

<p>“That the Tenth has indeed lost in Captain Mortimer
a great player, alike in amateur theatricals and
at—baccarat.”</p>

<p>A man appeared, the light flashing from the decorations
upon his breast, as he came slowly along the
garden path.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he repeated blankly.
“I—do—not—understand.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Ah! here comes Lord Ashley. Pray
excuse me. My next dance is his.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A NIGHT ALARM</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“A crown for your thoughts, Professor!” said
General Mainwarren to Professor Dean, as the latter
sat thoughtfully watching the dancers.</p>

<p>The Professor aroused himself with a slight start.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was allowing my thoughts to drift idly in
many currents,” he answered.</p>

<p>“For instance, if it is not impertinent to inquire?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was marveling at the beauty, the luxury
and the splendor of all this, and thinking what it
must cost to keep up. The thought occurred to me
that the cost of this one ball”—and the Professor
shot a sharp glance at General Mainwarren—“would
probably be sufficient to keep warm all the
poor people in your district who are likely to suffer,
according to what you told us, for coal this Winter,
in addition to supplying every poor child with a
Christmas box.”</p>

<p>“A Christmas box!” exclaimed General Mainwarren.
“What a quaint reminiscence wafted to us
from the past!”</p>

<p>“How do you mean—‘a quaint reminiscence’?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear Professor, Christmas boxes are
with us as much a thing of the past as the curfew
bell, knights in armor, or any of the other customs of
mediæval times.”</p>

<p>“How came this kindly practice to be abolished?”
asked the Professor blankly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“Kindly!” repeated General Mainwarren. “I
can’t agree with you. The custom was discontinued
long ago by the wealthier classes and the rest of the
people gradually followed. It was one of the few
good acts which the rich have done for the poor; one
of the many features in which our social organization
of to-day excels yours.”</p>

<p>“But what leads you to this view?”</p>

<p>“Why,” explained General Mainwarren, “your
giving of Christmas presents was nothing less than
the refinement of cruelty upon a colossal scale.
Think of the tens of thousands of heart yearnings
and of heart aches which must have been caused in
your day owing to this custom. It was all very nice
for the well-to-do, but think of the tens of thousands
who felt forced to give what they couldn’t afford; of
those who wished to give but could not; of those—especially
little children—who hoped to receive and
were disappointed. Think of the destitute father
looking upon his children as they wistfully watched
the toys and presents received by more fortunate
playfellows. What were the feelings in that parent’s
heart, what the feelings of the child’s? Ah! your
Christmas was a cruel time and your custom a cruel
one.”</p>

<p>“Viewed in that light,” answered Professor Dean
gravely, “I will admit there are grounds for your
criticism. You say there are other features of improvement.
Tell me of them. I’m interested.”</p>

<p>“The subject is rather too extensive to go into at
the present time,” answered General Mainwarren,
“but I’ll mention one or two instances which happen
to come to my mind at the moment. Take our newspapers,
for example. We don’t allow our newspapers
to promote national blindness as in your day. The
smallest size of type which may be used, as also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
numerous other details as to the printing of a newspaper,
are carefully regulated by law in the interests
of the public eyesight.”</p>

<p>“Not at all a bad idea!” commented the Professor.</p>

<p>“Then, again, take our attitude toward drunkenness.
We have recognized that what drove men to
frenzy in drink and largely promoted drunkenness
was not so much the liquor itself as the adulterations
in the liquor. Our methods of inspection of all
liquors publicly sold, as also of the public food supply,
are very elaborate, and our laws on the subject of
adulteration are extremely stringent. In this respect,
I am glad to say, our people are immeasurably better
off than were the people of your day.”</p>

<p>“You speak in a kindly way of the people and
seem to have their welfare at heart,” ventured the
Professor. “This being so, I am astonished that you
don’t reverse your policy.”</p>

<p>“My policy——?”</p>

<p>“As to the restriction of the coal supply.”</p>

<p>General Mainwarren started slightly.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to excuse me from discussing
that,” he answered, somewhat stiffly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Professor, slightly nettled,
“but there is one other point upon which I think I
have a right to receive your answer. It is this:
Under Colonel Cuming’s roof, you will remember,
you somewhat bitterly arraigned the men of my day.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I remember perfectly,” replied General
Mainwarren. “Conceding that the mass of people
have certain rights, I claimed that the responsibility
for present conditions lies with the people of your
day, because they did not check the tendency of
events in their incipiency. Of course,” he added cautiously,
“I haven’t accepted as correct your views as
to these rights. It was purely an academic discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and I conceded your point simply for the sake of
argument.”</p>

<p>“I understand the point you make,” rejoined the
Professor. “I was taken somewhat unawares at the
time, but the matter has been rankling in my mind
since. May I ask what were the methods which you
later critics think we might have adopted to this
end?”</p>

<p>“My dear Professor,” protested General Mainwarren,
“that’s a subject which to treat fully would call
for most extended discussion. Suffice it to say, that
in those days the people had the free exercise of the
ballot and with their votes they could have done pretty
well what they pleased.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you really think so!” exclaimed the Professor
with some sarcasm. “You forget our great
political machines, and that they practically controlled
affairs; substantially, even if covertly, directing
the so-called will of the people!”</p>

<p>“I’m fully aware of that,” answered General Mainwarren,
“but the man who stands idly beneath a tree,
with open mouth, awaiting the fruit to drop, is apt to
go away disappointed. What was needed was a slow,
steady, methodical education of the people, which
would have placed them upon a higher plane. With
eyes fully opened to the situation, they would have
been superior to the two great political machines.
There seems to have been no steady, earnest, well-directed
effort to accomplish this—no one to undertake
it!”</p>

<p>“How might this have been done?” questioned the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Oh, in various ways.”</p>

<p>“Tell me one?”</p>

<p>“Since you insist, my dear Professor,” answered
the General, “I’ll point out one way which has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
suggested and which I had the pleasure of discussing
some time ago with one of our most eminent sociologists,
Doctor Arthur Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“I’m all interest!” exclaimed the Professor.
“That way was?”</p>

<p>“You have intimated,” continued General Mainwarren,
“that the political machines held the voters
so securely that the power of these professional politicians
could not be overthrown by any opposition
which was started against them. You have not said,
but I know it, that such desultory opposition as was
tried from time to time always met with discouragement
and defeat. Nor have you pointed out that the
leaders who controlled these two great political machines
were themselves controlled by the moneyed
powers of the land, who stood in the background and
pulled the strings which moved the puppets. This—all
this—is well realized and understood by the
student of to-day.”</p>

<p>“Let us concede these facts,” rejoined the Professor;
“but what then?”</p>

<p>“It has been suggested,” continued General Mainwarren,
“that a wise course for patriotic leaders of
your day would have been to have abandoned the
hope of converting and securing the grown voters as
a body. It would have been best for them, at a given
time, to have said: ‘Beginning from to-day, we will
pay no attention to any male who is more than fifteen
years of age and who is now, or within the next
six years will be, entitled to a vote. But we will
direct all efforts to an entirely new body of suffragists.’
They should then have turned their attention
to the <i>women of the land</i>, to the mothers of future
generations of voters. It has been said that ‘Every
woman is at heart a royalist!’ It could with equal
truth be said, ‘Every woman is by nature a politician.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
It is true that women, as a body, appear to
devote little interest to politics, but this is because few
women have been given opportunity of acquiring any
knowledge on the subject, or of taking active part in
such matters. But whenever woman has had such
opportunity, she has shown herself to be an ardent
politician. Look at the influence exerted politically
by various women of whom history speaks. Take it
even in your own day. Whenever there happened to
be some movement—say a moral reform movement—in
which the women of the country took an
active interest, as they did now and again, did it
not invariably happen that that movement was successful
at the polls?”</p>

<p>The Professor reflected a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered; “the facts show that you are
correct as to this.”</p>

<p>“There, then,” continued General Mainwarren,
“lay the hope and the chance of your patriotic
leaders. They should have started missionary work
upon a comprehensive scale among the women of the
land. They should have educated womankind politically—have
indicated to woman where and why the
shoe pinched and what was the remedy. She should
have been shown that the remedy lay in the generations
of voters to come and that those generations
were directly under her influence and in her keeping.”</p>

<p>“I begin to see your drift,” said the Professor
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Meetings should have been held for the instruction
of women; political clubs maintained; and literature
circulated for them which was sufficiently light,
clear and instructive. ‘Do you want your sons to
struggle on under the same blighting, toilsome conditions
as their fathers struggled?’ should have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the watchword, and it would have been a watchword to
which the maternal heart would eagerly have responded.
The women would have educated their
children—not merely the boys but also the girls
who were to become the wives of future voters—and
within a very few years you would have had a new
generation of voters sufficiently powerful and sufficiently
well-instructed to have bid the old political
machines open and successful defiance. With the
women of the land lay one of your great chances, but
that chance you utterly neglected.”</p>

<p>The Professor was about to reply when the voice
of Kearns, who had been in conversation with Colonel
Cuming, broke in upon them:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Professor,” he exclaimed, “but I see
their Majesties have long since retired and the ball-room
is beginning to thin out somewhat. Isn’t it
time we went? No doubt all this life and go and
all these beautiful ladies are very interesting to you—in
spite of your hundred years—but you must remember
that I have work before me to-morrow. I’m
no longer a gentleman of leisure, you know.”</p>

<p>Before the Professor could reply, Colonel Cuming
again addressed Kearns, directing his attention to
some personage in the ball-room, and the Professor
turned to General Mainwarren.</p>

<p>“No longer a gentleman of leisure,” he said, rather
sadly; “that, too, was one of the subjects in my
mind. I was thinking what I should turn to—what
place I could find, if any—in this new world into
which I have tumbled. Our friend, Kearns, has
been fortunate in finding his old-time cunning in
demand, even at the hands of kings. But I wonder
if I can in these days profitably resume my former
researches and work. Would there be any demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
for the various inventions I have in mind—my air-ship,
for instance?”</p>

<p>General Mainwarren started perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Professor Dean,” he said gravely, “I have had a
high regard for you from the moment of our first meeting.
In fact, long before that your name was known
to me and your attainments in the domain of science
held my respect. Ah, Professor, you have probably
done for the world more than you know!”</p>

<p>“Come, come, General!” exclaimed the Professor,
“this is sheer flattery. You are amusing yourself
at my expense, I fear. I hardly expected this of
you.”</p>

<p>“I speak only the truth!” said the General
solemnly.</p>

<p>“We will let that pass,” replied the Professor
somewhat testily. “You have not yet answered my
question. Do you think the invention I have mentioned
would find any market in these days?”</p>

<p>“I was coming to that point,” answered General
Mainwarren. “I see no reason why your—your—invention
when completed should not yield beneficial
results.”</p>

<p>“Completed!” replied the Professor, “as far as
that is concerned, it is substantially completed.”</p>

<p>“Perfected!” exclaimed General Mainwarren,
with an air of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Professor.</p>

<p>“You could in—in—a comparatively short
time,” resumed General Mainwarren, “turn out a
practical air-ship! Do you mean this?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” replied the Professor confidently.</p>

<p>General Mainwarren reflected for some moments.</p>

<p>“Professor Dean,” he said presently, “I’ll make
you a proposition. Under these new conditions you
need someone to guide your efforts and to properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
market the product of your brain. I invite you to
come with me to Pennsylvania, and pursue your
researches and your work. It will be a mutual enterprise.
As for the terms, there will be no difference
between us as to that; they shall be of your own
making.”</p>

<p>“You mean this?” exclaimed the Professor in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Positively,” answered General Mainwarren firmly;
“I make you this as an offer. You are to pursue
your researches and your work at your leisure and I
am to supply such funds, or other promotive assistance,
as may be needed. The benefits accruing we’ll
share jointly, upon such terms as you yourself shall
dictate. It’s a simple business proposition. Do you
accept?”</p>

<p>“The conditions are certainly most liberal!” exclaimed
the Professor. “I——”</p>

<p>“Why, then, do you hesitate?”</p>

<p>“May I ask when this offer is to go into effect?”</p>

<p>“Immediately.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the Professor deprecatingly, “I
don’t want to leave my friend Kearns so suddenly. I
must ask for some time in which to reach a decision.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” answered General Mainwarren,
“but I ask it as a condition that you will not enter
into any negotiation or discussion on this subject with
outsiders until you have given me an answer. In a
word, you are to treat this proposition as entirely
confidential between us. Have I your word for
this?”</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left General Mainwarren’s
lips and before the Professor could make reply, there
came from the grounds outside the palace the sharp
blast of a bugle, hoarse shouts of command and the
sounds of moving men. In an instant the scene in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the ball-room changed from one of gayety and frivolity
to earnestness, joined to some confusion. Military
officers quitted their partners and hurried forth,
while the beautifully gowned women looked into one
another’s faces with questioning glances. The diplomats
gathered in little groups, exchanging whispers.
A current of unrest, of uneasiness, had suddenly
swept over the brilliant scene—a general presentiment
that something momentous had happened.</p>

<p>Again the bugles pealed forth, with a roll of drums
in the distance. Still the guests sat, or stood, looking
askance into one another’s faces. The music stopped.</p>

<p>Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. It
seemed as if the familiar words might be paraphrased:
“Uneasy are those who live within the shadow of a
throne.”</p>

<p>A messenger entered the ball-room and, glancing
about him, made his way to where Kearns sat. There
was agitation in his manner and his words came sharp
and terse:</p>

<p>“You are commanded, sir, to repair at once to His
Majesty’s chamber.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>HOW CAME THIS TO PASS</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Out of the ball-room the messenger rapidly led the
way. They were whisked up on an electric elevator;
and along a passage, lined with sentinels, they hurried
until they reached the private apartments of the
King.</p>

<p>In the first, or outer, chamber were gathered several
officers, talking together eagerly. They passed
through the chamber to a door at the further end,
where they were stopped by a Captain of the Guards,
who was evidently the officer on duty. At a whispered
word from the messenger, the officer moved
aside. The messenger opened the door and, stepping
back, motioned Kearns to pass in alone to the sleeping apartment
of the King.</p>

<p>Kearns instantly took in the details of the scene
which presented itself as the door closed behind
him—a spacious and brilliantly lighted apartment,
with a rather small alcove in which was set the royal
couch. Two persons were in the apartment—the
King, seated on the side of the couch, his face pale
and troubled, holding a paper in his hand; and, standing
beside him, Lord Ashley, looking very grave.</p>

<p>Lying in disorder at the King’s feet was a large
coverlid of gayly colored silk, which appeared to have
been thrown or dropped on the floor in the confusion.</p>

<p>The King motioned to Kearns to approach.
Kearns advanced and bowed.</p>

<p>“See!” said the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>He motioned to Lord Ashley, who raised the silken
coverlid. Kearns bent eagerly forward and, despite
the royal presence, a sharp, low whistle of astonishment
escaped him.</p>

<p>Stretched at full length upon the floor, his limbs
rigid in death, the thick blood oozing from nostrils
and mouth, lay the King’s great mastiff, with a bullet
through his heart.</p>

<p>Kearns stood gazing intently at the corpse; then
raised his eyes to glance about him for possible clews
as to the quarter whence death had been dealt. But
the King again drew his attention.</p>

<p>“Read!” he said, extending to Kearns the scroll
he held in his hand.</p>

<p>Kearns took the paper, which was thick and heavy
and was rolled in the form of a cylinder. Unfolding
it he read:</p>

<p><i>The bullet which pierces your dog’s heart might
as readily have reached yours. Heed the warnings
given while it is yet time. The hour fast approaches.</i></p>

<p>Kearns slowly read the document, refolded it carefully
and, still holding it in his hand, addressed the
King.</p>

<p>“I’d like to keep this,” he said, “for further examination.
I can’t tell but it may contain a clew.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” answered the King abstractedly.
“You note what is said: As the bullet pierced the
dog’s heart, so might it have pierced ours. And it’s
true,” he added with a shudder, “horribly true! As
the late Czar of Russia, Zoldau the First, foully perished,
so——”</p>

<p>Lord Ashley hastily interrupted.</p>

<p>“You forget, Sire,” he exclaimed, “that while it’s
true His Majesty, the late Czar, Zoldau the First,
died suddenly while asleep, yet it was officially certified
to by the Court physicians that he died of acute
indigestion superinduced by——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“A dagger, driven through his heart while he
slept,” interposed the King. “Yes,” he added with
ghastly irony, “such things usually are acutely indigestible.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said Lord Ashley, “there are certain State
secrets which His Grace, the Lord Chancellor, would,
I know, highly disapprove being disclosed. It is
not well that such rumors——”</p>

<p>“Rumors!” exclaimed the King with violence,
“think you, Milord, that these things are safely locked
within the walls of the Chancellery! Think you that
such secrets are securely hidden? that they are not
whispered about among the people? Ah, don’t deceive
yourself. But what care we as to this! All
the efforts of our officers, our soldiers, our Secret Service
have failed to protect us from these visitations.
We would that he,” and he turned to Kearns, “should
know all that he may fully grasp the necessities of the
situation and measure the danger.”</p>

<p>Lord Ashley bowed a respectful acquiescence.</p>

<p>“It’s horrible—horrible!” continued the King
with nervous energy. “It’s easy enough to face
death in a charge against the enemy as you soldiers
face it, but to wait and watch day after day, day
after day, never knowing from what quarter death
may be creeping upon you from some lurking assassin—ah,
that’s different. It’s horrible—horrible!”</p>

<p>Kearns looked upon the King and a feeling akin
to pity came into his heart. In the course of his
varied career, he had seen men in a similar predicament
and he well knew that this constant fear of
attack from some mysterious and unknown quarter
was a situation such as to wring the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>The King drew himself together with a strong
effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Whence came this shot?” he asked again turning
to Kearns.</p>

<p>Kearns glanced about him. There were four windows
to the apartment; two of these were closed; the
others were open. All four windows were securely
shaded with heavy blinds. Kearns crossed over and
carefully examined each window-casing and shade.</p>

<p>“Was it through a window?” continued the King.</p>

<p>“Possibly, Sire,” answered Kearns.</p>

<p>“You say possibly,” exclaimed the King, somewhat
petulantly, “yet how is it possible? On the ground
directly beneath those windows are two sentinels;
on the roof directly above are two other sentinels.
The trees of the park are many feet away and from
them no shot could be fired which could possibly
strike at the angle this shot struck. Besides, you
see the shades are undisturbed; no bullet has passed
through them. How do you account for all this?”</p>

<p>“I’ll know far more by this time to-morrow, Sire,”
answered Kearns calmly, “after I’ve concluded my
investigations. In the meantime, I ask that nothing
here be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“And you will speak then to-morrow?” exclaimed
the King eagerly.</p>

<p>“It was agreed, Sire,” said Kearns, with dignity,
“in order to ensure my usual success, that I should
be permitted to pursue my usual methods. I’ll speak,
Sire, at my usual time.”</p>

<p>“Speak at your usual time!” repeated the King,
apparently somewhat bewildered. “And when is
that?”</p>

<p>Kearns touched the foot of the prostrate dog lightly
with his own.</p>

<p>“When,” he answered with cold determination,
“when I hold the assassins within my net—securely
within my grasp!”</p>

<small>THE COUNTERPLOT</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“Tell me, Professor,” said Kearns to Dean at
fourteen o’clock on the following day, “I’ve reason
to believe I’ll need you badly in clearing up matters
here. Will you help me?”</p>

<p>“I’m a little hurt at the question,” replied the
Professor. “I should have hoped you would have
taken the answer as a matter of course. How long
will you need me? I’m at your service regardless of
the length of time; but I ask because the last thing
General Mainwarren did before leaving for Pennsylvania
this morning was to request me to communicate
with him speedily regarding the offer which he
made me.”</p>

<p>“How long shall I need you?” repeated Kearns
reflectively. “I can’t say. That depends, I imagine,
largely upon you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Professor Dean, “General
Mainwarren will have to wait. Suppose you begin
by telling me how I can be of use to you.”</p>

<p>“I have already explained to you the nature of the
case,” said Kearns. “I had another interview with
His Nibs—that is—ah—His Majesty, I mean—this
morning, but it did not result in my ascertaining
anything of value beyond that which I already
knew.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” commented the Professor.</p>

<p>“No. It seems,” continued Kearns, “that after
returning from the ball, the King immediately disrobed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
retired, and was soon sound asleep. He was
awakened by a sharp bark from the dog and sprang
up just in time to see the animal fall in its death
agony. At the same moment he noticed the flutter
of the white paper on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Was there no sound of a shot—no smoke?”
asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Kearns, “but there’s nothing
wonderful in that, because I’ve found that to-day
there exists not only a smokeless powder, but also
one that’s noiseless. Moreover, they have powerful
compressed-air guns from which such a shot could
have been noiselessly fired.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” assented the Professor. “And what
is your theory as to how that paper came there?”</p>

<p>“Gently, Professor,” exclaimed Kearns. “Let’s
take up matters in their regular order. We’ll put
off the discussion of that point for the moment. I’ve
told you what the paper contained. It was simply a
warning, accompanied by the threat that the next
warning received would be the last. It was a brief
document compared to others the King has received.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes; the visit of last night was the fourth. Upon
the first occasion, the King found beside his couch
a lengthy document embodying demands and threats.”</p>

<p>“And what was the nature of these demands?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they were quite lengthy and detailed,” answered
Kearns, “and were in the nature of demands
that he should bring about certain industrial and
economic changes, after which he was to abdicate
and restore the country to a Republic, with either
a President elected for a term of years, or at most a
life President. Failing to comply with these demands,
he was threatened with death as a usurper
and an enemy of the people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“From whom is this document supposed to have
emanated?” asked Professor Dean.</p>

<p>“To find that out,” answered Kearns, “is the
very mission upon which I am employed. I’ve
learned that there exists, as might be expected, a
strong body among the people who are opposed to
the new order of things and want to restore the
Republic upon substantially its original lines. They
are what we would call revolutionists, but the term
given to them at the Court is ‘Reactionists.’ They
are a secret body, much like the Nihilists of Russia,
and all efforts to discover and uproot them have so
far proved unavailing. Here and there certain conspiracies
have been from time to time unearthed and
the conspirators either executed or imprisoned, under
High Treason laws which are now in full force. The
captured men have always suffered like martyrs and
have gone to their doom resisting all temptations to
make disclosures. It’s known that the Reactionists
are divided into bodies governed by presidents and
that over them all is one supreme, able and powerful
head known as the High President. Beyond this,
practically nothing has been discovered by the spies
of the King.”</p>

<p>“You’ve raised a very serious question,” said
the Professor gravely. “As true Americans, with
whom ought our lot to be cast? With the monarchy,
or with these—these Reactionists?”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that,” answered Kearns, “but
what are we to do? We’ve tumbled into this state
of affairs, and it seems to me we must take things as
we find them. The monarchy to us is a visible and
tangible fact, whereas if we started out to-morrow to
find the Reactionists we wouldn’t know where to look
for them, nor whether they would want anything to
do with us if we found them. Remember, too, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
here we are, pitchforked into this new world, without
visible means of support, and the first thing for a
man to do is to find a sphere of occupation and employment.
I’m retained to make certain discoveries
in my particular line of professional usefulness. I’m
like a scientist employed to analyze the contents of
a particular stomach, or an advocate retained to present
a certain line of facts favorable to a given side.
I disclose the results of that analysis, or I present that
particular line of facts regardless of those who may
be affected thereby. It’s strictly in the line of my
professional activity—entirely within the scope of
my professional work and entirely conventional and
proper. It doesn’t seem to me that it would be wise,
though, for us to plunge into the troubled sea of
politics—at least for the present.”</p>

<p>“There is much truth in what you say,” replied
the Professor. “Such discussion is, I suppose, fruitless.
What more did you discover?”</p>

<p>“First let me ask you a few questions,” retorted
Kearns. “How about that steering balloon—that
air-ship—of yours? How near was it to completion
when you went to sleep?”</p>

<p>“My air-ship!” repeated the Professor with astonishment.
“The invention, as far as related to all
the main points of discovery, was practically completed
at the time this misfortune befell us.”</p>

<p>“Misfortune!” repeated Kearns. “I really don’t
know whether that’s the right way to put it. Remember
if it hadn’t been for that misfortune, you
and I would be shades, playing harps upon some damp
cloud, for perhaps the last quarter of a century. A
live scientist is worth a dozen dead geniuses any
time. However, never mind about that. Let’s come
back to the balloon.”</p>

<p>“The air-ship!” corrected the Professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Well, then, the air-ship,” continued Kearns.
“Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the Professor with enthusiasm,
“that involves quite an explanation on the subject
of aëro-mechanics.”</p>

<p>“Is it like a balloon?” questioned Kearns.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” exclaimed the Professor, “my air-ship
differs as much from a balloon as a modern
steamship from a mediæval caravel. Drifting aimlessly
about between earth and sky in a balloon at the
mercy of the air currents is one thing; to travel rapidly
through space and navigate the air at will is
an entirely different proposition. This latter is what
my air-ship does.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“Yes; not only are you enabled in my air-ship,”
continued the Professor, “to travel through space
at a rate of speed exceeding that of the fastest steam
engines of our time, but you can navigate absolutely
at will. The motive power is stored electricity,
joined to a new force which I discovered, and which
is one of the important features of my invention. I’ll
not touch upon the suspensory power,” continued the
Professor, launching forth upon his theme with the
enthusiasm of the scientist, “for that is too simple.
Let me explain to you the combined motor and
atmospheric counter resistant forces by which the
aërial guidance is ensured. Imagine a central turret—we
owe the basic invention on this point to the
distinguished scientist Roowalter—a central turret,
I say, furnished with powerful concentric screws connected
with a number of lateral phalanxes, or——”</p>

<p>“Merciful powers, Professor!” cried Kearns,
“you make my head swim. Why, man alive, you
might as well explain all this to a stone wall as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
me, for all I understand of it. Your thing floats and
travels fast and can be steered, eh?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” answered the Professor indulgently.</p>

<p>“And how big is it?”</p>

<p>“You can build it any size you please,” replied
the Professor. “It can be built so large as to——”</p>

<p>“What is the smallest practical size?”</p>

<p>“About as small as an ordinary row-boat, only
somewhat deeper and more pointed at the prow.”</p>

<p>“It can be made to stand absolutely still in space?”
continued Kearns.</p>

<p>“Again, I will compare it to a row-boat,” replied
the Professor. “If the motor power be shut off it
will remain practically still, drifting more or less
lightly in the air currents, just as a row-boat, unpropelled
by the oars, drifts in the water according as
the currents are more or less strong.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you could grapple with an anchor
or other attachment, to the trunk of a tree, or the
side of some structure, would it take much force to
hold your machine perfectly still?” questioned
Kearns.</p>

<p>“Very little,” answered the Professor, “in fact,
I can again best illustrate by suggesting a row-boat
held steady by a boat-hook.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” answered Kearns slowly and with a
thoughtful air; “I think I understand. And how
long,” he continued, after a moment’s reflection,
“would it take you to build a machine of this character?”</p>

<p>“Of what size?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the smallest size.”</p>

<p>“That would depend,” answered the Professor,
“upon the facilities at my command. Given a shop
fully and efficiently equipped, I could turn out my
air-ship in a remarkably short time. Like most good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
things, it presents the merit of much simplicity after
once the right principles have been discovered. You
see——”</p>

<p>“What do you call a short time,” interrupted
Kearns, “assuming you had the highest facilities?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t like to specify exactly——”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” broke in Kearns impetuously; “would
it be a day—a month—a year?”</p>

<p>“Since you insist,” replied the Professor, “under
pressure and assuming that I was furnished with the
highest facilities, my invention is so well advanced
and the practical details are so clearly outlined in
my mind that I could produce an air-ship of the
smaller type in from two to three weeks.”</p>

<p>Kearns sprang forward with a joyous exclamation.</p>

<p>“Professor,” he cried, “you shall build that machine.
You shall have the highest facilities—the
very highest facilities—I promise you, but it must
be ready within a month at latest!”</p>

<p>“Why—why—what do you mean?” exclaimed
the Professor with mingled joy and astonishment.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” retorted Kearns. “Suffice it that
the King will refuse me nothing I need to assist me
in my investigations. And now, I have one other
question to ask. Does your machine leak at times?”</p>

<p>“Leak!” repeated the Professor, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean,” explained Kearns, “does it ever
exude, drop, drip, let fall—or whatever you like to
call it—a liquid of any kind?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what you mean!” exclaimed the Professor,
his face lighting up. “Why, yes. To the
right side and below the level of the main turret, there
is a secondary storage box. The decomposition of
the chemicals in this box produces the power to——”</p>

<p>“Now, Professor,” interrupted Kearns, “please
don’t wax technical. Remember, as I told you, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
stone wall is a light and airy thing compared to my
density as to matters mechanical.”</p>

<p>“Very well, O marvel of density!” retorted the
Professor with light sarcasm; “I will endeavor to
explain so that even your benighted brain may grasp
and understand. What would you do if you had a
grate full of coals and the coals had burned out and
you wanted more fire?”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” replied Kearns mischievously, “that
I should ring the bell and tell the servant to make
up the fire.”</p>

<p>“And how would the servant do it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose by putting on more coals,” answered
Kearns cautiously.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” sniffed the Professor contemptuously,
“does it not occur to you—O man of self-vaunted
thickness!—that the servant might indulge in some
operation prior to putting on those fresh coals?”</p>

<p>“Huh!” exclaimed Kearns, with a puzzled expression;
“I suppose you mean that there would
first be a raking out of the ashes.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the Professor; “you are beginning
to betray an intelligence which is almost
human. Now, so it is in the case of the air-ship.
In that secondary storage box to which I have referred
are certain chemicals which furnish power.
When a portion of these chemicals have exhausted
their activity, a residuum gradually forms, corresponding
to the ashes in your grate, only it is in
liquid form instead of solid. This residuum is
allowed to escape through a valve and is thus carried
away and, of course, the storage box is fed from
time to time, as may be required, with fresh energy-producing
chemicals.”</p>

<p>“Let me see if I understand it,” persisted Kearns
with obstinacy. “This liquid residuum, as you call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
it, leaks away through the bottom of the air-ship,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You may put it that way,” said the Professor,
smiling.</p>

<p>“And that blamed old dripping liquid residuum
would either burn into, or else make a deep brown
stain upon any fairly soft material it touched,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” exclaimed the Professor excitedly; “a
dark brown stain. But how—how did you know
this?”</p>

<p>“Not bad, eh?” retorted Kearns, “for a marvel
of density! In course of time—O sage of a century
of Wisdom!—and under your able direction,
you’ll find that almost human intelligence of mine
gradually developing itself.”</p>

<p>“But how did you know this?” persisted the Professor.</p>

<p>“Patience! O Aged Wise Man of the decomposing
chemicals, main turrets and cylindrical tubes,” retorted
Kearns; “patience, I say! Didn’t I tell you
that under my methods everything must come in its
proper order? Listen, then, and you’ll learn.”</p>

<p>“I’m all attention,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“I commenced my operations this morning,” began
Kearns, “by making a thorough examination of
the <i>locus</i>. I’ll not weary you with a long description
of the preliminary details of my investigation—how
I extracted and took possession of the bullet
which had been fired and thoroughly examined the
apartment, its surroundings—everything.”</p>

<p>“I think we may trust you for that,” remarked
the Professor, with a smile.</p>

<p>“The King’s sleeping apartment,” continued
Kearns, “is in the extreme western wing of the
palace. It is a spacious apartment, with two alcoves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
One of these alcoves contains the royal couch; the
other, the royal bath. There are four windows and
two doors. One of these doors—that leading out
on the passage—is securely sealed from the inside;
the other leads into the antechamber. In this antechamber
there is on duty every night a Captain of
the Guard, and the outer corridor is watched by three
sentinels. At the extreme end of the corridor is
another apartment also at the disposal of the Captain
of the Guard. Should anyone appear at the end
of the corridor, the sentinel would signal to his comrade,
who would in turn signal to the third sentinel
and the officer on duty would come forth and receive
the visitor in the apartment at the extreme end of the
corridor. This is done to prevent any sound in the
antechamber disturbing the King.”</p>

<p>“Quite elaborate precautions, I see,” commented
the Professor.</p>

<p>“Just so,” resumed Kearns. “Now, last night,
Captain Bingham, of the Guard, was on duty and
I’m satisfied from what he tells me that no one visited
the corridor after the King had retired. In
fact, nothing happened until the sharp ring of the
electric signal in the King’s chamber caused Captain
Bingham to rush in and we know what he found
there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” assented the Professor.</p>

<p>“I said I wouldn’t weary you by going into unnecessary
details,” continued Kearns, “so I’ll omit
the further investigations pursued by me and come
to the point at once by telling you that I’m satisfied
that no attack came from either the corridor or the
antechamber. It came from without.”</p>

<p>“From the windows?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. There are four windows to the apartment.
Two of these were closed last night and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
open. All were shaded by heavy blinds which had
been drawn fully down. The windows are forty-five
feet from the ground and fifty-five feet below the
palace roof. The grounds immediately beneath are
patrolled by two sentinels, and on the roof immediately
above are two other sentinels. The windows
look out upon the park and the nearest tree to any
of the four windows is sixty-five feet away.”</p>

<p>“It would seem a safe enough retreat and one certainly
very difficult of approach by an enemy,” remarked
the Professor.</p>

<p>“And yet,” replied Kearns, “that was the point
from which the attack came. The King is extremely
fond of air. He experiences a sense of suffocation
whenever he is closed in an apartment which is not
sufficiently airy. Confident in the sentinels above
and below and in the inaccessibility of his chamber,
it has been his custom to sleep with two of the windows
open. I examined these windows carefully,
inside and out. I discovered only one thing. It
was not much and yet—yet—I think it means
something.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” inquired the Professor eagerly.</p>

<p>“On the under side of the stone ledge under one
of the windows, I discovered three sharp scratches
and four small but rather deep indentations.”</p>

<p>“Ah! is that all?” exclaimed the Professor with
an air of disappointment.</p>

<p>“That was all,” replied Kearns calmly, “yet to
me it means something.”</p>

<p>“What do you think?”</p>

<p>“That by gripping onto the under part of that
window ledge, something was held in place there—moored,
if you so like to call it.”</p>

<p>“I fail to follow you,” remarked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Kearns, “if that’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
case, we’ll leave the window and maybe you can follow
me into the grounds. But before doing that, let
me tell you one other fact I discovered. It was this:
I inquired into the exact dates on which the three
previous attacks had taken place and made another
little discovery.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Was there any moon last night?” asked Kearns,
suddenly breaking off.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Professor, after a moment’s
reflection; “the last quarter went out three nights
ago.”</p>

<p>“And last night was quite a dark night, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Professor; “slightly hazy and
overcast.”</p>

<p>“Any heavy wind?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Professor.</p>

<p>“Just so,” continued Kearns, “and it was the same
on the occasions of the other three attacks. I’ve consulted
the weather records and in each case found a
night following shortly after the wane of the moon’s
last quarter—a dark, starless night, with light
winds. Do you begin to scent an African in the
woodpile?”</p>

<p>“I fear I must have a cold,” retorted the Professor,
“for so far my sense of smell detects nothing.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Kearns, “follow me into
the grounds. I carefully examined the trees there—not
merely the trunks, but also the tops. And
among the leaves and branches of some of the tops I
discovered something more.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That a number—quite a large number—of the
leaves had great blotches where they had been eaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
away and a number of the twigs and boughs had big
brown splashes. I followed these marks in a westerly
direction until I came to the river. There I
lost them and all efforts failed to discover where they
resumed on the bank. Now, do you begin to discover
anything?”</p>

<p>“Speak out,” cried the Professor in ill-restrained
excitement; “say what you mean!”</p>

<p>“I’ll endeavor to make it plain to your intelligence,
O man of self-convicted density!” retorted
Kearns triumphantly. “What do you think was the
something which could come, in dead of night, under
the window, forty-five feet above the ground, and be
unseen by the sentinels above and below; the something
which put a mark upon the stone ledge as if it
had been moored there by the sharp prongs of a boat-hook;
the something that leaves behind it burns and
dark brown stains upon the leaves and branches of
the trees?”</p>

<p>“What—what—can be the meaning of this?”
stammered the Professor, his face working with excitement.</p>

<p>“That there are,” rejoined Kearns, “other distinguished
scientists and inventors besides Professor
Dean—that the work he dropped fifty years ago
has been taken up by others and secretly perfected.”</p>

<p>“An air-ship—an air-ship!” gasped the Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” retorted Kearns, “yes, O man of cranks
and cog-wheels, an air-ship. An air-ship coming on
dark and windless nights, between moons, passing unseen
the sentinels on turret and in grounds, and mooring
under the windows of the King to deliver its
attack. So will it come again! And it is with an
air-ship, designed and built by you, that we must
and can alone meet the attack.”</p>

<small>THE EAVESDROPPER OF THE QUEEN’S WALK</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“Say, Dorothy!” cried Beatrice Cuming, sweeping
into Miss Brandon’s apartment with the energy
and enthusiasm of a miniature cyclone; “I’m so glad
to catch you alone—so glad! I was afraid somebody
would be here and I wouldn’t have a chance to
talk to you right away.”</p>

<p>Dorothy shifted her fair head from its position
on the cushions of her easy-chair and turned her blue
eyes upon the speaker.</p>

<p>“Why, what has happened, Trixy?” she asked
with languid interest. “It must, of course, be something
of much importance, considering it’s almost
an hour since you left me.”</p>

<p>“An hour!” exclaimed Beatrice; “let me tell you,
a whole catalogue of wonderful things can happen in
an hour. And so it is here. I’ve a whole bookful
to tell you—a romance—a love affair—a tragedy!”</p>

<p>“Your introduction is certainly promising, Trixy,
dear,” remarked Dorothy with the same languid interest,
“but it’s rather lengthy. Remember, long
introductions to romances have been out of fashion
since the days of our great-grandmothers. Wouldn’t
it be well to begin your story?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just how to begin it,” answered
Beatrice ingenuously, “it’s so interesting. But,”
she added suddenly, “you’re quite sure you meant
what you told me the other day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Told you the other day?” inquired Dorothy,
puzzled; “told you about what?”</p>

<p>“About your not caring anything for him, of
course?”</p>

<p>“And who may ‘<i>him</i>’ be?” asked Dorothy, with
an ever so slight change of voice.</p>

<p>“Why, Captain Mortimer, of course!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Dorothy, her face flushing
slightly, “of course not. How silly you are,
Trixy!”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Beatrice, “I thought I’d make
quite sure, you know. Dear old papa says I’m
always blundering into things without first making
proper inquiry, so I thought I’d make quite sure in
this case. I wonder who it can be, though?”</p>

<p>“Who what can be?”</p>

<p>“Never mind!” retorted Beatrice; “listen to my
story first, and we can then put our heads together
and try to guess who the <i>she</i> is.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Dorothy, slightly arching her
eyebrows, “you have really decided to begin, then?”</p>

<p>“Stop, Dorothy,” protested Beatrice, “don’t tease
me! You’ll drive some of it out of my head and I
don’t want to forget anything. Let me see; where
shall I begin? Oh, yes! Well; after I left you
I went for a stroll in the park. It was such a beautiful
day; the smell of the flowers and the grasses was
so sweet that I kept on and on almost to the end of
the Queen’s Walk. Presently I felt tired and looked
about me for a place to rest. I saw a seat some little
distance away and I kept on until I reached it and
there I sat down. Do you follow me, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“I find no difficulty in doing so thus far, Trixy,”
answered Dorothy, with a smile. “Consider that
I’ve followed you to the seat at the end of the Queen’s
Walk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“I hadn’t been there more than a few minutes,”
resumed Beatrice, “when I noticed, around a bend in
the path, two officers approaching. Who do you
think they were?”</p>

<p>“Remember, Trixy,” answered Dorothy, “you
are supposed to be telling a story—not propounding
riddles!”</p>

<p>“Why, Captain Swords and Captain Mortimer,
Dorothy!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” remarked Dorothy very quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes. They were talking together and they didn’t
see me. What do you think I did, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Now you are asking a riddle, Trixy,” replied
Dorothy. “You waited until they came up, I suppose,
and then monopolized their attention during the
rest of the promenade!”</p>

<p>“All wrong—all wrong!” cried Beatrice gayly;
“nothing of the kind! Right back of my seat was
a big tree, or bush—as high as this room and half
as big around. Watching them closely and being
quite sure they hadn’t seen me, I crept around to the
back of that bush and hid.”</p>

<p>“Hid!” exclaimed Dorothy in astonishment;
“why, what was your object in doing that?”</p>

<p>“Just this,” said Beatrice, with a merry laugh;
“I thought they might take the seat I had left and,
if they did, what fun it would be to creep up behind
them and drop a few grains of gravel down the collar
of Ralph’s uniform.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the idea!” exclaimed Dorothy, with a
shocked air. “And, Trixy,” severely, “since when
have you taken to calling the officers of the Guard
by their first names?”</p>

<p>“Captain Swords, I should say, of course,” replied
Beatrice, not in the least abashed; “but he’s
so jolly and all his brother officers call him Ralph.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
It seems so much easier to call him that. What a
brave fellow he must be, too! Captain Bingham was
telling me how he—Ral—Captain Swords, I
mean—rode out to retake the abandoned guns at
Vladivik and how he was wounded. Oh, I just
thrilled as I listened to that story.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed Dorothy, apparently catching
Beatrice’s enthusiasm, “but Captain Mortimer was
there, too. It was he, after all, who brought in the
guns and, though wounded, carried Captain Swords
from under the Russian fire.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and Ralph—Captain Swords, I mean—was
decorated with the Columbia Cross,” said
Beatrice.</p>

<p>“So was Captain Mortimer,” replied Dorothy,
“besides receiving mention in General Orders.
But,” she added hastily, “are we going to discuss
the Russian War, dear, or are you going on with your
story?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it must have been you who interrupted
me, dear,” rejoined Beatrice imperturbably. “Let
me see, where was I? Oh, yes! I had hidden behind
the big bush. Well, on they came and, sure
enough, they seated themselves at the very place I
had just left. For a while they sat there quite still.
Neither of them said anything and from my hiding-place
I could smell the smoke of their cigars. I
was trying to find some gravel, but I couldn’t discover
any behind the bush, so I was stooping down looking
for some pebbles of the right size, when suddenly
Captain Swords’ voice came to me. ‘Stanley, old
fellow,’ he said, ‘there’s been something wrong with
you the last few days. Won’t you speak out and tell
me what’s the matter? Usually there are no secrets
between us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“It seemed to me a long time before the other
made any reply, but at last his voice came to me.</p>

<p>“‘Ralph,’ he said, ‘I want to get out of this—to
get away from here. I’ve made up my mind to leave
the Guard and exchange into the Tenth, or some other
regiment.’</p>

<p>“‘You astonish me, Stanley,’ replied Captain
Swords; ‘for I thought it was rather jolly here and
that you found it so, too. But, be that as it may, if
you want to exchange, then exchange let it be for
both of us. Just say the word—when?’</p>

<p>“‘What! You’ll leave the Imperial Guard, too?’
the other exclaimed.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Captain Swords, ‘we’ve always been
together. Whenever you go, I go with you. Still,
I’d like to know just what has put you out of sorts
with things here.’</p>

<p>“Again there was a long pause before there came
an answer. I was puzzling just what I ought to
do—whether to come out and announce myself, or
stay quietly where I was. You see, having unintentionally
listened so far, I was embarrassed and
didn’t know quite what to do. Before I could make
up my mind, Captain Mortimer again spoke.</p>

<p>“‘Ralph,’ he said, ‘I’ll be quite frank with you.
Before I came to this cursed Court, my experiences
with women had been the ordinary ones of a soldier.
I hadn’t been here a week, though, before I met one
who appealed to me as no other woman ever had.
No need for me to name her. You know whom I
mean.’</p>

<p>“‘The women here do seem to have a decidedly
queer effect upon a man,’ answered Captain Swords.
‘I have noticed that. But I didn’t mean to interrupt.
Go on, Stanley.’</p>

<p>“‘Ralph,’ said the other one, and his voice seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to me to shake as he spoke, ‘I’m an infernal fool. I
loved that woman—loved her passionately, reverently,
madly. Her presence, her voice, her touch
seemed to open the gates of heaven to me—the world
was different from what it ever had looked to me before.
It was heaven and yet there was a hell in it,
too. Ralph, I tell you, man, if you’d be happy,
never love a woman like that.’</p>

<p>“‘Poor old fellow!’ said Captain Swords.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Trixy, dear,” exclaimed Dorothy,
suddenly wheeling her chair, “but the light hurts
me. You won’t mind my turning this way, will
you? No, dear, don’t move. I like your voice to
come to me that way—from behind me. I’m listening.
Continue.”</p>

<p>“Very well, let me see where I was,” resumed
Beatrice. “Oh, yes; Captain Swords said: ‘Poor
old fellow!’ and then the other continued:</p>

<p>“‘I told you, Ralph, that I was an infernal fool
and that’s putting it mildly. I loved her and I was
fool enough for a brief, mad period to hope—to believe—that
she loved me. Lady Brooke happened
to speak her name one night and incidentally mentioned
a few details concerning her. Lady Brooke
said she was a favorite with the Queen and that she
was considered to be one of the richest heiresses of
the Court. As she said the words, Ralph, I went
sick all through me. I felt as when that Russian
bullet hit me at Pedershof, for I had known nothing
of this and here, it seemed, was an unexpected
barrier between us. Lady Brooke, however, went on
to say—and she warned me that this was strictly
confidential, of course—that this report, like many
other reports, had little foundation in fact; that in
reality the lady’s money was largely in expectancy
as the heiress of her maternal uncle, Sir Ray Murray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the head of the Copper Trust; that Sir Ray was
engaged in a war to the death with Sir Brussels Page
and that the whole thing might result in Sir Ray’s
financial annihilation, in which case the lady’s supposed
millions would dwindle to nothing. It seems
a strange, I might say almost a mean thing, Ralph,
to rejoice at some form of ill-fortune touching the
woman you adore, but the truth is the truth—I did
rejoice at those words of Lady Brooke. Those millions
would have been a barrier between us. Without
them, I felt she was nearer to me. Lady Brooke is
a handsome woman—although I never particularly
took to her—but she never looked so handsome to me
as at that moment. I could have laughed out—laughed
out loud and long—as she spoke pityingly
of the almost certain loss of those confounded millions.
Just as if the man who wins her for her own
sweet sake alone will not be richer than the royal
heir who comes to his throne.’”</p>

<p>“He said that—he said that! You heard him
say that?” murmured Dorothy, from her chair, in a
strangely muffled voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; of course that’s what he said,” replied
Beatrice, engrossed in her story. “Am I not giving
you the exact words?”</p>

<p>“Go on—go on.”</p>

<p>“There now! You’ve thrown me all out by interrupting
and I’ve lost the thread.”</p>

<p>“Please forgive me. What did they say next?”</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed Beatrice, “Captain Swords
asked him why he had given up hope. Why was it
that he thought the lady didn’t care for him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; yes!”</p>

<p>“Then the other answered him this way: ‘Ralph,
it’s all over. I’m just as much a “goner” as a solitary
picket cut off and surrounded by a sotnia of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Cossacks. You remember, Ralph, the night of the
ball—the last one. I danced twice with her that
night and twice, as we danced, she looked into my
eyes and I could have sworn I saw the love-light there.
I was encouraged, Ralph—buoyed up by my fool
hopes and went blindly on to the awful ambuscade
that lay for me at the end of this lover’s lane I was
treading. After the second dance, I walked with her
in the great conservatory and there, my brain whirling,
I told her—I don’t know what!’”</p>

<p>“‘And she refused you?’ Captain Swords asked.</p>

<p>“‘Refused me!’ the other answered, oh! so sadly;
‘well, she listened to the end and then gave a little
laugh, treated it all as a mere jest—a nothing—murmured
some words which I was too dazed even to
understand—and left me hastily to join her partner
for the next dance.’</p>

<p>“‘The cursed coquette!’ I heard Captain Swords
say savagely.</p>

<p>“Then the other turned upon Captain Swords
fiercely and declared that he wouldn’t hear one word
of reproach spoken of her in his presence; that
whatever she had done was, beyond question, right;
no doubt that was the way of the ladies of the Court,
and if rough soldiers, who had spent their lives in
camp and field, didn’t properly understand those
ways, it was their fault and they ought not to complain.”</p>

<p>“How noble—how generous!” came from the
figure in the chair.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it, Dorothy!” continued Beatrice; “but
that’s not all. He said that after the lady had refused
him, he remained in the conservatory for some
time and then, not very well knowing what he was
doing, he wandered back to the ball-room to catch
another glimpse of her as she danced with that black-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> 
devil, Lord Ashley, as he called him. Then
he went on to say that as he stood there, Lady Brooke
came up and began to talk to him. She drew his
attention to the lady and asked him if she and Lord
Ashley didn’t make a handsome couple—she so light
and he so dark. Lady Brooke said that she thought
there would surely be a match, as she had been playing
her cards to win Lord Ashley because of his title,
and a titled husband was the one thing above everything
that the lady had set her heart on.”</p>

<p>“She said that—she said that to him!” cried
Dorothy, suddenly sitting upright in her chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; that’s what she said and more too. She
went on to tell him that she thought the lady would
very likely succeed and would become Lady Ashley,
as she was a clever and skilful angler, but did he not
think that she angled for him a little too openly and
too boldly?”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh! What——”</p>

<p>“Now don’t interrupt me, Dorothy,” exclaimed
Beatrice, completely engrossed in her story, “or I’ll
lose it all again. Well, when Lady Brooke said
that to him the one wish in his mind, he said, was that
she were a man and he would have strangled her
where she stood for those words she had spoken.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and then he went on to say that whomever
she chose—whether lord or commoner—would be
fortunate, indeed, and that he hoped she would be as
happy as he knew she was good and beautiful. Then
he told Captain Swords that he should always love
her, with the loyalty a soldier has for his flag;
worship her with the blind idolatry of a fanatic for
his God. He said that if war should again break
out, it would find him at the front and that when he
fell his one hope was that her face might be the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
vision to pass before his eyes; her name the last word
upon his lips. Oh, Dorothy, I tell you he spoke so
beautifully and so sadly of her that I just sniveled
behind the bush and the sob I gave nearly betrayed
me. As for Captain Swords, I could hear him
pacing up and down the path and he flung his cigar
away with such violence that it flew clear over the
big bush and almost fell on my head. I wish I had
someone to care for me like that. As for Lady
Brooke——”</p>

<p>At the mention of that name, Dorothy suddenly
sprang from her chair and confronted Beatrice with
pale face and strained, wide-staring eyes.</p>

<p>“The wretch—oh, the wretch!” she murmured
fiercely. “Such base falsehood!”</p>

<p>“Why, Dorothy,” exclaimed Beatrice, startled,
“why are you so excited?”</p>

<p>“Excited! Who wouldn’t be in the face of such
horrible untruths—such a dreadful mistake!”</p>

<p>“Why, why, Dorothy!” cried Beatrice quickly.
“Do you know anything of this? Who the lady is?
Is she some friend of yours? Have I made you
unhappy?”</p>

<p>Dorothy took a step forward and put her arms
around Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Unhappy!” she stammered; “oh, I’m wretched—so
wretched. No, no; I mean I’m happy—so
very happy. You don’t understand.”</p>

<p>But Beatrice released herself and looked anxiously
into her friend’s face.</p>

<p>“What has happened, Dorothy?” she inquired
with concern. “You are ill! You are all white
and red by turns.”</p>

<p>“No, no; you don’t understand!”</p>

<p>“Understand, eh!” quoth Beatrice, the light of
a sudden intelligence coming into her eyes. “Oh!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
I see—I see. There now! Just to think of it!
As papa would say, I’ve been blundering again.”</p>

<p>“See! You see what?”</p>

<p>“But you distinctly told me,” came the somewhat
irrelevant answer, “that you didn’t care for him!”</p>

<p>“Why, of course—of course not; you silly, silly
goose! You don’t understand—you don’t understand——”</p>

<p>And by way of adding to Beatrice’s comprehension
of the situation, Dorothy suddenly drew her to her
heart, sank her head upon her shoulder, and, with
great broken sobs following fast upon one another,
wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<small>THE TAP OF MILADI’S FAN</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“Do you think <i>it</i> will surely come? Are you confident
that this entire hypothesis of yours is correctly
grounded?” and Professor Dean peered with wistful
anxiety into Kearns’ face.</p>

<p>That personage stared silently for a moment into
the Professor’s inquiring eyes, and then answered
with imperturbability:</p>

<p>“Will ducks swim?”</p>

<p>“I believe that according to established natural
laws,” answered the Professor acidly, “they will.”</p>

<p>“Will this air-ship of yours fly?”</p>

<p>This time the Professor’s reply showed some
warmth.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it been tested? Haven’t you seen for
yourself? Aren’t you satisfied?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” conceded Kearns bluntly. “Well;
just as sure as ducks swim and as your air-ship flies—and
mighty high and rapid is its flight, I’ll admit—so
surely will my hypothesis, as you call it, turn out
scientifically correct and I’ll run my quarry to
ground. I’m not accustomed to failure, you know,
and I certainly can’t afford to fail in this case.
Didn’t the warning say that the next will be the last?
That means, I take it, there is going to be at least
one more warning and, judging from past success,
they’ll adopt the same means and the same methods
as before. This is just about the time when things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
are due; the night, too, judging from present indications,
looks as if it would be the right kind. I’d not
be astonished if this was the night!”</p>

<p>The conversation was held in a spacious apartment
of the Summer Palace immediately to the west
of the King’s sleeping apartment, forming part of
the suite in the palace assigned to the affairs of the
Chancellerie. Stretching across the apartment upon
two rests, which brought it to a level with the wide
bay windows, was a machine resembling in length and
general contour an ordinary steam launch, but differing
materially from a steam launch in its various
accessory details. It was Professor Dean’s much-prized
air-ship—christened by Kearns “The Royal
Dean.”</p>

<p>The various component parts of this air-ship had
been manufactured with much secrecy at one of the
royal dockyards. The parts had then been forwarded
to a secluded portion of the country, where
a temporary workshop had been fitted up for the Professor.
There the assembling of the parts had taken
place and the final and successful tests made. Thanks
to the careful and elaborate precautions taken, no
inkling of the nature of the work had filtered abroad.
Only three of the workmen engaged on the assembling
really knew that an air-ship had been turned out, and
these three were very securely taken care of for the
present.</p>

<p>The same careful and secret precautions were observed
in bringing the air-ship to the Summer Palace
and installing it there. At Kearns’ suggestion, the
Court had abandoned the Summer Palace at the time
the work was first begun, the Queen and her suite
going to Emberton, and the King and his suite to the
City Palace.</p>

<p>At last the work on the air-ship had been completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and that portion of the Chancellerie suite adjoining
the King’s sleeping apartment had been given over to
Kearns. There, after certain preliminary work in
connection with one of the big bay windows so as to
permit of the ready exit of the air-ship, the installation
had taken place.</p>

<p>Then and not until then, Kearns gave the word
and the King and Queen, accompanied by their respective
suites, returned to the Summer Palace. This
return took place while there were yet three nights
left of the waning moon—just in the nick of time,
as Kearns put it.</p>

<p>There was, however, one matter troubling Kearns.
The necessity of secrecy and also of compactness of
construction had been such that it had only been
possible to construct an air-ship of very moderate dimensions—an
air-ship equipped to carry only two
persons. Now, one of these persons must necessarily
be Professor Dean, since he alone was competent to
navigate the aërial craft. Who was to be the other
passenger? Equally obviously—as Kearns himself
was compelled regretfully to admit—it could not be
Kearns. In following the attacking party, it was impossible
to predict what situations might be encountered
or what exigencies might arise. To cope properly
with these situations and meet these exigencies,
necessarily required some person who was familiar
with existing conditions and customs, otherwise the
whole pursuit might result in failure and the marauders
escape. A man who had only recently excited the
risibilities and the wonderment of rustics by inquiring
for a horse and carriage was hardly the right man
for the task. Sadly and with woebegone mien,
Kearns had to concede it.</p>

<p>The solitary passenger accompanying the Professor
must be a man familiar with existing conditions—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
man of authority, of resource and of courage.
Casting about them for a selection, neither
Kearns nor the Professor could think of any person
possessing better qualifications for the work in hand
than Captain Stanley Mortimer, of the Imperial
Guard. Following upon Beatrice’s introduction and
the Captain’s invitation to visit his quarters, they
had both formed his acquaintance; he had shown
them various little attentions and kindnesses; both
were impressed with him.</p>

<p>But Captain Mortimer’s military duties as an
officer of the Guard might possibly interfere with his
movements on the critical night. There must also
be a substitute, in case of emergency, and naturally
they selected Captain Mortimer’s comrade, Captain
Ralph Swords.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, therefore, Kearns consented and the
subject was broached to the two officers, under strictest
promise of secrecy. To no one must they breathe
one word of the expedition, neither before nor after
the event, until relieved from their respective promises
by Mr. Kearns.</p>

<p>Both eagerly consented to embark upon what promised
to be at least an interesting adventure. They
had contemplated leaving the Imperial Guard and
exchanging into another regiment, but in view of this
adventure they decided to postpone matters.</p>

<p>Following his customary methods, Kearns communicated
these selections to no one—not even to
the King. Mr. Kearns liked to deal only in results.</p>

<p>In addition to the air-ship, there was a “little side
invention,” as Mr. Kearns termed it, which gave
that gentleman much satisfaction and comfort. The
Professor dubbed it “an aërestograph,” but Kearns
preferred to refer to it as “the aërial telegraph.”
This latter not inaptly described it. It was an instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
fastened to the end of a support some four feet
in height. Supplied each with one of these instruments,
two persons many miles apart could interchange
messages, without the use of any connecting
wire, provided there were no interfering obstructions.
The Professor referred to it as an exceedingly simple
invention, based to some extent upon the same
principles as those applied by Marconi, but with
apparatus much simplified. One of these instruments
was mounted in the room in the Chancellerie
given over to Kearns; the other instrument was stored
away in the air-ship. By rising in the air-ship to
a sufficient altitude to clear intervening obstructions,
there would thus be constant possibility of communication
between the air-ship and Kearns. By means
of this instrument, Kearns felt that he was at least
in touch with the Professor and the news.</p>

<p>So matters stood on the night of the recorded conversation
between the Professor and Kearns. The
night was dark—slightly hazy and overcast—corresponding
in many respects, as Kearns noted with
joy, to the night when the previous visitation had
taken place. To complete further the resemblance,
a ball was being held in the Summer Palace—not
upon the scale of magnificence of the preceding event,
but a Court ball, nevertheless, with all the accessory
brilliancy and gayety.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight, the Professor, Kearns and
Captain Mortimer sat watching in the room of the
Chancellerie assigned to them. Immediately next to
them, but separated by a solid wall, was the King’s
sleeping apartment, in the antechamber of which
Captain Swords was on duty as Officer of the Day.</p>

<p>Not long after midnight a messenger handed a note
to the sentinel at the end of the corridor. It was
passed on from sentinel to sentinel until it reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Captain Swords. It was a delicately perfumed little
missive, addressed in a large and straggling feminine
handwriting. The Captain tore it open and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Captain Swords: Since you have been so inconsiderate
as to be on guard to-night, you might at least
send Captain Mortimer to dance one little waltz with
me. He, too, seems to have disappeared. If you
don’t manage this little favor for me, you need never
speak to me again.</p>

<p class="right">“B. C.</p>

<p>“P. S.—I am awfully disappointed and angry.</p>

<p>“P. P. S.—I may be at the entrance to the
Queen’s Walk at fourteen o’clock to-morrow, but it
would be no use for you to try to meet me there, because
I should refuse to tell you anything interesting
which might have taken place at the ball.”</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Swords smiled as he read, afterward
standing for a moment, reflecting, with the note between
his fingers. With the air of a man who has
suddenly made up his mind, he left the antechamber,
walked up the corridor past the King’s apartment and
knocked lightly at the nearest door of the Chancellerie
suite. Captain Mortimer promptly responded to the
summons and a brief whispered conference took place
between them. Then Captain Mortimer turned to
Kearns and whispered:</p>

<p>“I suppose ’twouldn’t do for me to absent myself
for half an hour—to go downstairs for one dance.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” replied Kearns. “The King hasn’t
yet retired and isn’t likely to for some time. It’s
certainly too early to expect anything. Go, by all
means, but don’t stay too long.”</p>

<p>Still Captain Mortimer hesitated.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like by my absence to spoil any
chance,” he said.</p>

<p>“No danger,” answered Kearns; “besides, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
anything happen unexpectedly, we could summon
Captain Swords.”</p>

<p>“But he’s on duty in the King’s antechamber.”</p>

<p>“Well, we could immediately send for you to take
his place.”</p>

<p>“That would be somewhat irregular,” objected
Captain Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Go,” insisted Kearns. “You’ll be perfectly safe
in doing so, provided you are back here by the time
the King retires.”</p>

<p>“Oh, long before that,” answered the Captain, and
off he started for the ball-room, Captain Swords returning
to his post of duty in the antechamber.</p>

<p>On reaching the ball-room, Captain Mortimer had
little difficulty in discovering Beatrice, seated between
Dorothy Brandon and Baroness Maquehaye. He
made his way to where they sat and, presenting himself
before them, bowed.</p>

<p>“I come under orders from Captain Swords,” he
said to Beatrice, “to act as his proxy for this waltz.
May I have that honor?”</p>

<p>But the young lady looked up at him with large
and mischievous eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m so angry with Captain Swords,” she answered
severely, “that I’ll not dance with him even by
proxy. I’ve decided to give the waltz to Count D’Arville,
of the French Legation. Ask Miss Brandon.
Perhaps she may take pity on—Captain Swords’
proxy.”</p>

<p>At these audacious words, Miss Brandon turned
several colors and cast a sharp and furious glance
upon Beatrice, who sat demurely looking up at the
Captain. Captain Mortimer also glanced quickly at
the speaker, but if the glance conveyed astonishment
it certainly contained no anger. With presence of
mind, he turned to Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“You’ve witnessed my discomfiture,” he said.
“Won’t you take pity on me?”</p>

<p>“As a proxy?” she asked, with an arch upward
flash of the eyes.</p>

<p>“As a proxy, or—as you will!”</p>

<p>For answer she rose and took his arm.</p>

<p>They gained their positions upon the floor; the
band struck up the opening bars. Once more his
arm encircled her; once more he held her to him, as
they glided around and around, amid the maze of
waltzers. Again he felt the intoxication of her presence;
the sweet, pleasurable thrill of physical contact
which set heart and nerves a-throb within him.
Through his brain there flitted the wild phantasy that
for the mad joy of holding her enfolded in his arms,
her heart crushed against his heart, his lips to her
lips—that for one long minute of such ecstasy he
would be willing to suffer instant annihilation thereafter.
Then came the thought, sharp as a sword-thrust,
that perhaps this waltz was their last, their
eternal farewell; that never again might he hold her
thus. So they danced on, the minutes seeming as
seconds, until the band played the final bar and the
waltz was at an end.</p>

<p>Half-dazed, he started to lead her back to her seat,
but with a gentle restraining pressure upon his arm,
she stopped him.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to return yet,” she said, and the look
she gave him was half-beseeching, half-imperious.
“Let us walk around a little. You don’t mind, do
you?”</p>

<p>Mind! What was he not willing to pay for every
additional moment that gave him her gracious presence!</p>

<p>He did not—he could not—answer, but he instantly
turned and with her on his arm, walked in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
opposite direction. There was too much crowding
upon the floor for comfortable walking; mechanically,
without intention on his part, he made his way to the
entrance to the great conservatory and they passed in.</p>

<p>“I suppose this is the last place I should seek,”
he said, at last finding speech and scarce knowing
what he was saying.</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked archly.</p>

<p>“A soldier, you know, seldom cares to revisit the
scene of a reverse,” he said.</p>

<p>“I have read somewhere,” she answered demurely,
“that all great soldiers seek to retrieve a reverse, and
Captain Mortimer, it is said, is a great soldier.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for the compliment,” he answered
with some embarrassment; “but I fear you are
amusing yourself at my expense.”</p>

<p>“One doesn’t amuse oneself,” she answered
gravely, “at the expense of those who wear that
Order,” and she touched lightly with her gloved
finger-tips the Columbia Cross glittering upon his
breast. “You must tell me some day the story of
how that was won,” she continued in a low voice.
“I’d like to hear the details from your own lips.”</p>

<p>“I fear narration is not my strong point,” he
answered, again evincing embarrassment. “Besides,”
he added hastily, “the credit of that affair
really belonged most largely to the dearest fellow on
earth—my comrade, Ralph Swords.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of Captain Swords’ connection with
that affair,” said Dorothy dryly; “but I don’t always
believe quite all I hear.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, “just as people sometimes
say things they don’t fully mean, I suppose. For instance,”
she continued with meaning, “indelicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
and careless remarks in the excitement of play at
baccarat!”</p>

<p>“Indelicate and careless remarks—baccarat!”
he repeated, with evident wonderment. “I realize I
am stupid, but I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>She turned her great eyes upon his face and as she
saw the perplexity there her heart gave a joyful leap.
Long ago she had to herself fully exonerated him
and had pitilessly condemned herself for having ever
entertained a single doubt. Now, it seemed, the entire
story of the infamous Brooke was a falsehood
woven out of whole cloth. Still, with the spirit of
inquisition natural to womankind, she determined to
probe the entire matter to the bitter end.</p>

<p>“Yes; at baccarat, I said,” she answered gayly.
“Weren’t you with the Tenth before you came to
the Guards?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, wondering what was coming
next.</p>

<p>“And the Tenth were sorry gamblers, were they
not?” she persisted. “Was there not a great deal of
baccarat playing toward the close of the season at
Oldport?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I ought to disclose the
secrets of the mess-room,” he replied; “but I don’t
mind admitting what was generally known and
talked about. Your information is quite correct, I
regret to say.”</p>

<p>“You regret?” she asked. “Why? It is
rumored that Captain Mortimer was one of the most
assiduous devotees.”</p>

<p>“Then rumor falsifies,” he answered gravely;
“for I disapprove upon military grounds of all
forms of gambling in military quarters. <i>I never
played baccarat in a regimental mess-room in my
life.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>She gave a little cry of astonishment and joy.
Complete, indeed, was this refutation of the tale of
the Brooke!</p>

<p>“Why,” she exclaimed, with the inconsequence of
a true woman, “why did you never tell me this
before?”</p>

<p>“Tell you before!” he repeated. “Why should
I?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she answered, panting, “I’m
still quite angry with you.”</p>

<p>“Angry?” he asked, perturbed. “Why? Because
I haven’t played baccarat?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she retorted impatiently. “Because
you are so credulous.”</p>

<p>“Credulous?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied petulantly. “What was that
interesting story told to you at the last ball regarding
a certain lady who shall be nameless? A story
which you accepted and believed, I suppose!” she
added indignantly.</p>

<p>He stared straight ahead and made no reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was told to you in strictest confidence, I
presume?” she pouted.</p>

<p>“That which I’m told in confidence I make a
point of forgetting I’ve ever heard,” he replied,
fencing. “You surely will not blame me?”</p>

<p>“That’s doubtless right,” she admitted; “but let
me say,” she added with meaning, “the waters of a
certain Brooke may babble not only unceasingly, but
also very falsely. Will you bear that in mind if you
should remember a certain confidence?”</p>

<p>“You’re not angry with me?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“Very little,” she answered; “in fact, so little
that you may have the next waltz—if you care
for it.”</p>

<p>A troubled look came into his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“I fear I can’t,” he replied with disappointment.
“I’m on duty and must return at once.”</p>

<p>“On duty!” she exclaimed; “why, I understood
Captain Swords was on guard to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “he is; but I’m on special
duty—a scouting expedition, I might say.”</p>

<p>“A scouting expedition!” she repeated. “You
speak as if it were a time of war. Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he answered reluctantly. “I am
pledged upon honor not to speak of it.”</p>

<p>Her blue eyes opened wide in mingled astonishment
and concern.</p>

<p>“If there is so much secrecy,” she said slowly, “it
must be a matter of importance. Is there any
danger to—to—you?”</p>

<p>“I could hardly say there is,” he answered lightly.
“Call it an interesting little adventure—nothing
more serious than that.”</p>

<p>But she was not lightly to be put aside.</p>

<p>“On your honor, is there no danger?”</p>

<p>“None that I know of,” he answered reassuringly.</p>

<p>“That you know of?” she repeated. “Then you
can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“No,” he admitted, “the circumstances are so
novel—so unusual—I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>They had reached a secluded part of the great conservatory
and stood facing each other, she with
downcast eyes, he looking down upon her with rapt
admiration.</p>

<p>“I must return,” he whispered; “although never
did I go to duty so unwillingly.”</p>

<p>She took his arm and they walked slowly back
toward the ball-room.</p>

<p>“Why so silent?” he whispered to her as they
walked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>She sighed.</p>

<p>“I have a foreboding,” she answered sadly, “that
this undertaking—this secret expedition of which
you cannot speak—is one of difficulty and of
danger.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he answered cheerily; “you’re mistaken.
But,” he added in a low voice, “were it so,
would you care?”</p>

<p>For answer, she looked upward and her glance met
his. Softly he whispered to her and more softly still
came her whispered reply—a reply that brought the
light to his eyes and the hot flush of joy to his cheeks.</p>

<p>It was with that light in his eyes, that color in his
cheeks, they passed out of the conservatory into the
ball-room. Not ten paces from them as they entered
stood a man wearing the uniform of the Imperial
Guard. As they walked, he looked after them,
with black brows bent and an expression in the dark
face that was not good to look upon. He turned
sharply at a tap from a lady’s fan upon his arm, the
scowl still upon his face.</p>

<p>“Ah, Lady Brooke!”</p>

<p>“A word with you, Milord Ashley,” she said.</p>

<p>He led her aside and they stood for some minutes
engaged in conversation.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he said to her as she was about to
pass on. “You may count upon my managing it.”</p>

<p>“And you may count upon me,” she answered,
“to repair matters when the proper time comes. As
you are aware, I still have some influence with His
Majesty.”</p>

<p>Lord Ashley bowed low.</p>

<p>“Repair, eh!” he muttered under his black mustache
when she had gone, “if you’ll consult the past,
Milady, you’ll find that when I’ve finished with
those who cross my path, there’s little left to repair!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Your suggestion is good, though, Milady! You certainly
are a born <i>intrigante</i>. An excellent suggestion,
indeed! And I’ll lose no time in carrying it
out!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK</small></h3>
</div>

<p>A last, lingering pressure of the hand, a hasty
exit from the ball-room and Captain Mortimer hurried
back to his post of duty. He reached the corridor,
returned the salutes of the three sentinels as
he passed, and went into the antechamber. He
stopped for several minutes’ conversation with Captain
Swords and then made his way to the first door
of the Chancellerie suite. A light tap and the door
was opened by Kearns.</p>

<p>“Back in good time, I hope!” whispered the
Captain.</p>

<p>“In plenty of time,” Kearns whispered in return,
as he hastily closed the door. “I’m glad you went.
It’s not very interesting sitting here in the dark,
without even the privilege of a comforting cigar.
Still, I’ve had a few experiences of the kind before.”</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer removed his sword and stored
it away in the air-ship. It was a strict military regulation
that officers should appear abroad only in
uniform and wearing their swords.</p>

<p>“I’d suggest,” he said as he took his seat beside
them, “that it might help pass the time if Mr.
Kearns would tell us some of the many interesting
experiences he doubtless had in his time. The darkness
here will lend an additional thrill. What say
you, Professor?”</p>

<p>“We’ll get enough thrills before we’re through
with this adventure, provided our friend Kearns’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
theory is correct,” replied the Professor dryly;
“still, if he’ll tell a story, I’ll be glad to listen.”</p>

<p>“No, no;” protested Kearns; “all my interest is
centered in that park and in watching for what may
come from over those tree-tops. Ah, listen!”</p>

<p>As he spoke there came three faint, but distinct,
taps on the door; then a pause, followed by four
similar taps.</p>

<p>It was the agreed signal which Captain Swords
was to give when the King retired.</p>

<p>“From now on we may expect something,” remarked
the Professor.</p>

<p>“Interesting but scientifically inaccurate,” retorted
Kearns. “Before long we may expect, but
not just yet. You must allow for some time after
the retirement of the King before you can expect any
manifestations. It’s now fully an hour earlier than
the time of the preceding visit.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” replied the Professor; “still I’ll
wager, for all that, you wouldn’t care to have us go
to sleep during the next hour.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” assented Kearns; “one can
never be quite sure what may happen. Those fellows,
whoever they may be, seem to know pretty
well what takes place in the palace. They doubtless
have a confederate, or confederates, on the inside.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” said Captain Mortimer. “Have
you made any efforts to discover?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” answered Kearns. “I’ve been
too busy with other matters. I’m after the main
quarry. The subordinate details, if necessary, can
be attended to later.”</p>

<p>This seemed sound reasoning and neither of the
others ventured a reply. The moments slowly
passed. They sat there in the darkness exchanging
only occasional whispers. They heard the chime of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
one of the palace clocks—an hour had passed and
still nothing. Again the clock chimed; it was the
quarter. The sound had barely died away in the
darkness of the summer night, when Kearns laid a
light touch upon the Professor’s arm.</p>

<p>“<i>At last!</i>”</p>

<p>The three bent their heads together.</p>

<p>“Look upward—to the right!” came the low
whisper.</p>

<p>They strained their eyes in the direction indicated.
Faintly seen in the darkness was a shadowy something,
the outline of some black object floating in the
air.</p>

<p>“Steady!” whispered Kearns, in an ever so faint
whisper. “Not a move till I give the word!”</p>

<p>The dark object, though still indistinct, became
gradually more clearly outlined. It crossed at some
little distance out and above their window, passed
the windows of the King’s apartment and was lost to
their view opposite the window of the antechamber
where the King’s officer on duty kept guard.</p>

<p>“An air-ship—an air-ship, sure enough,” whispered
the Professor. “And apparently painted dead
black.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” replied Kearns, “but this time we’ll
match your gray one against the black. Great Scott!
To think that I’m not in the race.”</p>

<p>Several minutes passed and the ship did not reappear.</p>

<p>“My God!” exclaimed Captain Mortimer, “you
haven’t allowed them to escape us?”</p>

<p>“Hush, no!” answered Kearns; “do not fear.
They’re cute ones. They’re scouting and ’ll surely
return.”</p>

<p>The whispered words had hardly left his lips when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the air-ship reappeared. This time it halted in a line
with the King’s window.</p>

<p>“Steady and quiet!” said Kearns. “The time
has come.”</p>

<p>Quickly, silently they rose and took their positions
in the air-ship, as it lay upon its rests. Stealthily
Kearns crept to the window and with one turn of the
well-oiled and carefully prepared machinery, the
entire bay window curved outward, leaving a wide
opening. Through this gap, the launch-like air-ship
skilfully guided by the Professor, gracefully slid
into the night. Rapid as had been these movements,
they were not more rapid than those of the attacking
party. As the window flew back and the prow of the
air-ship passed out, the Professor and Mortimer saw
them loosen their mooring, turn about and away. By
the time the opening had been cleared, the pursued
were several lengths in the lead, but the royal air-ship
was following hot in their wake.</p>

<p>High over the tree-tops of the park they flew and
on and on until they reached the river. Thus far
they had maintained their respective distances,
neither apparently gaining or losing.</p>

<p>“Turn on the flash-light!” called out the Professor,
“or we may lose them in the darkness.”</p>

<p>An instant later a bright stream of light shot forth
from the prow of the “Royal Dean,” flooding with its
radiance the pursued.</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer and the Professor saw that the
craft before them was slightly larger than their own,
of a dead black color and contained three men.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, there!” came a moment later the hail
from the pursued. “Who are you? What company
do you belong to?”</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he commanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>At sight of his uniform in the glare of the search-light,
there seemed to be a sudden consternation
among the pursued. Their air-ship shot upward to
greater heights. Instantly the Professor handled his
levers and followed. A hurried conference between
the pursued seemed to be taking place.</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer picked up a repeating rifle from
the floor of the air-ship.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” he shouted, his voice ringing strong
and clear; “surrender, you rebels, in the name of the
King!”</p>

<p>No attention was given to this summons. The pursued
kept steadily on, heading toward the north.</p>

<p>“Halt!” again commanded Captain Mortimer,
raising his rifle. “Halt, or I fire!”</p>

<p>For answer to this, a man appeared in the stern of
the pursued bearing before him a bowed shield.
From the ease with which he handled it, it was apparently
very light but doubtless strong enough to
withstand a bullet. There was a steel projection at
the base of this shield and, in the light of the flash-light,
they saw him drop this projection into a socket.
The shield was thus held in place and the occupants
of the air-ship protected from any pistol, or rifle fire,
from the rear.</p>

<p>It was a revelation to the pursuers. The attacking
party was not only furnished as an aërial scout, but
was furthermore equipped as a species of armored
aërial cruiser. The Professor drew his companion’s
attention to this fact.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Captain Mortimer, “and if
they were supplied with means of offense, such as
repeating rifles, they would be not only an aërial
cruiser, but a very effective aërial man-of-war. Do
you think there’s any vital part of their craft, so that
I could disable them with a bullet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Our craft could not be so disabled,” answered
the Professor; “neither, so far as I can judge, could
theirs be.”</p>

<p>“Then we must flank them,” said Captain Mortimer,
“and try to bring them to terms in that way.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the Professor; “I’ll see
what I can do.”</p>

<p>He accordingly endeavored to navigate his craft
to a position on their left quarter, but the pursued
were wary and quickly shifted, keeping the protecting
shield between themselves and the pursuers. At
last, by clever manœuvering, the Professor had
almost succeeded, when up went another shield, effectually
protecting a large section of that quarter.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” exclaimed Mortimer, laying down
the rifle; “it’s a veritable armored cruiser. No matter
what quarter we flank them on, they undoubtedly
have enough shields to protect all sides. By heaven!
they seem to be drawing away from us.”</p>

<p>“Yes; they’ve certainly increased the distance between
us somewhat,” assented the Professor, “but
they’re not as far away as they were a few minutes
ago. I don’t understand it. They seem to gain and
then we seem to creep up on them a little. Perhaps
this may be due to certain effects of the air currents,
but it is decidedly peculiar.”</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer made no reply. He sat watching
the pursued craft, distinctly outlined in the rays
of the flash-light. On and on they rushed at topmost
speed through the yielding air, grown raw and
chilly. The first streaks of light began to flicker in
the east. The pursued now rose to still greater altitudes,
until the air became uncomfortably rarified.
The Professor manipulated his levers and the pursuers
followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“What are they up to now?” asked Captain Mortimer.
“Trying to dodge us?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” answered the Professor. “It looks
more to me as if they were trying to keep out of sight
of land as the daylight comes.”</p>

<p>“Any chance of our giving out?”</p>

<p>“No; we can keep this up for many hours yet.”</p>

<p>“And they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Judging from the qualities they
have shown so far, it’s best to assume they are fully
as well equipped as we.”</p>

<p>“What are the prospects of overtaking them?”</p>

<p>“Not very favorable, I should say,” replied the
Professor. “We’ve been going at our topmost ever
since we started and yet we haven’t gained upon them.
In fact, they’ve gained a trifle on us. You see, they
are somewhat larger and probably have more power.
As it is, I am astonished we haven’t lost them before
now.”</p>

<p>“What’s the likelihood of our losing them altogether?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say,” replied the Professor, “but our
chances against losing them improve every minute as
the light comes on. We’ll soon be able to at least keep
them in sight for a very great distance. You may
shut off the flash-light now.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing you can suggest?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered the Professor. “Under existing
conditions, there are only two courses open
to us.”</p>

<p>“And they are?”</p>

<p>“Either to keep on as we are doing, or give it up
as a bad job.”</p>

<p>“Give up!” exclaimed Mortimer in a disgusted
tone. “I’m unalterably opposed to that. We started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
out to follow them, and follow them we will until
either this air-ship gives out or we overtake them.”</p>

<p>“Or we lose sight of them,” suggested the Professor.</p>

<p>“Or we lose sight of them,” assented Mortimer
grudgingly; “but I trust you’ll do your best to avoid
that.”</p>

<p>“You may count upon it that I will,” answered
the Professor stoutly.</p>

<p>“Besides,” continued Mortimer, “they can’t keep
this up forever. They’re making for some point and
some time or other they must effect a landing. Then
it will become interesting. Hello! what are they
up to now?”</p>

<p>“They are descending. See! they are increasing
the distance between us, too.”</p>

<p>“If they descend, it will give me a chance to pot
them from above,” suggested the Captain, again taking
up the rifle.</p>

<p>“It seems awful to fire upon them,” exclaimed the
Professor wistfully; “especially as they are not offering
us any attack, but are only seeking to escape.”</p>

<p>“Fire upon them!” cried Mortimer warmly; “I
may fire, but I have certainly no intention of hitting
them. I would, though, send the bullets sufficiently
close to make matters look serious and possibly stop
them. But to shoot men in cold blood—never! I
am an American soldier, sir, of the twentieth century
and we’ve nothing in common, thank God! with the
assassins of your day—the butchers of Little Knee
and the murderers of gallant Sitting Bull.”</p>

<p>“Sitting Bull!” exclaimed Professor Dean, with
astonishment, “so he has passed down in history as
one of the legendary heroes and a reproach to the men
of my day.”</p>

<p>“Very decidedly,” answered Mortimer. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
should read Goodrow’s history on the subject and
Krebiel’s noble poem, ‘The Death of Sitting Bull.’”</p>

<p>“History is certainly a strange thing,” commented
the Professor. “Argument is somewhat difficult at
this altitude; besides, I’ve these pesky levers to look
after. I should like to take up that subject with you
later, though. By the way, do they still play a game
called ‘poker’ these days?”</p>

<p>“My dear Professor,” answered Mortimer, “the
American game of poker is immortal.”</p>

<p>“And they still bluff at the game?”</p>

<p>“Probably more so than ever.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not have an opportunity of trying the bluff
you spoke of,” said the Professor, as he nodded
toward the pursued. “See the protecting shield go
up.”</p>

<p>Mortimer looked and saw a shield had been so
adjusted as to at least partially protect the air-ship
from an attack from above.</p>

<p>“A cunning set!” commented Mortimer.</p>

<p>“That’s what our friend Kearns said they were,”
replied the Professor. “I suppose we had best follow
them and return toward earth.”</p>

<p>Again the Professor juggled with his levers and
they shot rapidly downward.</p>

<p>“There’s something else going on there,” remarked
Mortimer as he eyed the pursued. “What is it?”</p>

<p>They had descended many hundreds of feet. A
number of mountain tops, apparently forming part of
an extensive range, were more or less indistinctly outlined
below.</p>

<p>“Mountains?” commented the Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mortimer, “and from the general lay
of the land I should say the heart of the Adirondacks.
But what are they doing there?” he inquired
eagerly, pointing to the pursued, who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
manœuvering with some instrument projecting over
one of their quarters.</p>

<p>The Professor watched closely for some minutes.</p>

<p>“It’s some signaling instrument,” he said at last.
“They are signaling the land.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>“WHO ARE YOU”</small></h3>
</div>

<p>The movements of the pursued craft, which Professor
Dean described as signals, continued for only
a short time and then once more the pursued rose to
a great altitude. The “Royal Dean” tenaciously
followed.</p>

<p>“I thought we were going back to earth, but now
it seems that we are heaven-bound,” remarked the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Whether they make for heaven or the other
place, we’ll follow them as long as there is a follow
left in us,” answered Mortimer grimly.</p>

<p>For some twenty miles the mysterious craft kept
its way, then, still at the same altitude, suddenly
described a great semicircle, and laid a course due
south.</p>

<p>“What are they up to now?” questioned Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know,” replied the Professor. “It
looks very much as if we were going back the way we
came.”</p>

<p>“Curious!” commented Mortimer. “I suppose
we can only follow and await developments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“That’s all,” assented the Professor.</p>

<p>The opinion expressed by Professor Dean that
they were returning over practically the same course
proved to be correct. Back they went for some
twenty miles, and then the pursued began to descend,
followed, of course, by their obstinate pursuers.</p>

<p>The occupants of “The Royal Dean” perceived
they were dropping into a great valley, shut in on
all sides by towering mountain tops.</p>

<p>“It seems we are to make a landing at last,” remarked
Mortimer, scanning the valley beneath.</p>

<p>There was no reply to this remark. Mortimer
turned leisurely to address the Professor again, but
was startled to see the latter staring with dilated
eyes into space.</p>

<p>“See!” he gasped. “There! Ah, and there!”</p>

<p>Mortimer looked in the direction indicated and
was dumbfounded to perceive to the westward, slightly
above them, another air-ship bearing down.</p>

<p>“Look over there!” exclaimed the Professor,
pointing to the East.</p>

<p>Mortimer shifted his glance to another air-ship.
An instant later two more appeared, the one to the
North and the other, beyond the line of the pursued
air-ship, to the South.</p>

<p>“We’re surrounded,” gasped the Professor,
amazed. “What’ll we do? Try to escape? I fear,
though, it will be useless, judging from the speed
which I see they develop.”</p>

<p>“Useless or not,” replied Mortimer obstinately,
“we started out to follow that air-ship and follow it
we will to the bitter end.”</p>

<p>Even as they spoke, the four air-ships were rapidly
closing in upon them and they could see that they
were several times the size of the “Royal Dean”
and that they carried a number of men. As they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
drew nearer, they saw what appeared to be miniature
cannon protruding from their quarters. An instant
later the air-ship to the West came within hailing distance.
A man stepped to the prow and shouted
something which they did not clearly hear.</p>

<p>“They evidently want to speak to us,” said Dean,
and he slowed down and came to a stop.</p>

<p>The air-ship to the West also checked its speed, but
still kept slowly approaching. The other three air-ships
were fast closing in.</p>

<p>“Why did you stop?” asked Mortimer with some
annoyance. “We don’t want to let those fellows
get away from us.” He nodded in the direction of
the pursued.</p>

<p>“No fear,” answered the Professor. “They are
descending straight into the valley.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” shouted Mortimer to the air-ship to the
West.</p>

<p>“Hello!” came back the answer. “Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“His Majesty’s air-ship, the ‘Royal Dean’,” replied
Mortimer, adding with an aside and a chuckle
to the Professor: “How’s that?”</p>

<p>The reply appeared to exercise a strange effect
upon the men addressed. The man in the bow turned
to those behind him and a brief parley seemed to
ensue. Finally he turned about and again hailed
them.</p>

<p>“You are our prisoners!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Prisoners!” roared back Mortimer. “By what
authority do you dare thus address an officer of the
King’s Guard?”</p>

<p>All four air-ships had now drawn quite close and
had come to a stop. All were drifting in the air
currents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Authority!” called back the spokesman.
“You’ll learn that later. Surrender!”</p>

<p>Mortimer was standing in the extreme bow of the
air-ship. He turned to his companion.</p>

<p>“Professor, hand me that rifle.”</p>

<p>Professor Dean bent forward and picked up the
rifle from the floor of the air-ship. As he rose with
the weapon in his hand there came a warning shout
from the spokesman.</p>

<p>“Fire one shot,” he cried, “and we will blow you
to the moon!”</p>

<p>“You scoundrels!” called back Mortimer, “try
it!” And he turned to the Professor, holding out
his hand for the rifle.</p>

<p>The Professor calmly drew back and dropped it
over the side of the air-ship.</p>

<p>“What have you done—what have you done?”
cried Mortimer furiously.</p>

<p>“Saved you from yourself!” replied his companion
coolly. “I don’t mind your fighting when
you have half a chance, but to resist here is sheer madness.”</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer paused an instant, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re entitled to some consideration in
this matter,” he said sulkily. “There may be some
truth in what you say. Perhaps I can best aid the
cause I serve by exercising diplomacy for the moment
and biding my time.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking concentrated sense,” replied
the Professor. “That’s the proper way to look at
it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the air-ship on either side had drawn
close in upon them. Each of these air-ships threw
out a long, powerful prong, resembling a giant boat-hook,
and held “The Royal Dean” securely. Words
of command rang out and an instant later the two air-ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> 
began descending at moderate speed to the valley
below, drawing down the captive craft between
them. Mortimer picked up his sword and buckled
it about his waist. The Professor was silent. Both
stood in their respective positions, expectant and alert
but offering no further resistance.</p>

<p>They reached the bottom of the valley and gently
grounded upon tufted grass. As they did so, the captives
glanced about and saw that they were surrounded
by a number of rough-looking men, who had
evidently been awaiting the landing. They also saw
with some astonishment that in the forward rank
stood a young woman, jauntily attired in a natty
hunting costume. A short skirt of some dark material
fell over a pair of high-laced russet shoes and a
pert red feather peeped forth from the saucy little
hat which covered her short black curls. As she
stood watching the captives, her cheeks flushed with
excitement and her black eyes sparkling, she presented
a remarkably pretty picture of a brunette of
the slender, sinuous type.</p>

<p>There were hurried exclamations, greetings and
questions—addressed by the men on the ground to
the men in the arriving air-ships. The answers
seemed to cause considerable perturbation and excitement.
At a word of command two men stepped forward
and seized Captain Mortimer roughly by the
shoulders.</p>

<p>In an instant he had shaken them off, and with two
smashing blows sent them sprawling to the ground.</p>

<p>“I surrender,” he said; “not to you, you scum; to
the lady!”</p>

<p>And he raised his hand in military salute.</p>

<p>One of the men struck lay on the ground, apparently
stunned, but the other sprang to his feet with an
oath. His hand flew to the back of his belt and out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
flashed a long, ugly-looking knife. Mortimer sprang
lightly over the quarter, set his back against the side
of the air-ship and drew his sword. A murmur—half-angry,
half-excited—went up from the surrounding
groups of men. At the prospect of a fight
their curiosity and interest were whetted. The man
with the knife crouched as if seeking an opportunity
to spring in and attack, while Mortimer stood coolly
on the defensive, a half smile upon his face, as he
watched the man’s awkward points.</p>

<p>At this juncture the girl turned and hastily whispered
to a tall, rawboned man who had just climbed
out of one of the capturing air-ships. He instantly
broke through the ranks and came forward.</p>

<p>“Back, Jackson,” he cried to the man with the
knife; “quit now!”</p>

<p>“He hit me,” replied the man, with a savage growl,
“and I’m going to rip him up. Out o’ the way,
Cap’n.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if two could play at that game,” replied
the man addressed as Captain, with a grin.
“Back, I say. This man is a prisoner and goes before
the Colonel.”</p>

<p>With some hesitancy the man sheathed his knife
and slunk back among his fellows.</p>

<p>“Follow me!” said the Captain to Mortimer;
“and you, too,” he added, nodding to the Professor.</p>

<p>The latter clambered over the side of the air-ship.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” he said.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know whether I am,” cried Mortimer,
still standing sword in hand. “Who are you?
A military organization, or a band of outlaws? I
hear you speak of captains and colonels! And by
what authority do you talk of prisoners?”</p>

<p>“I can’t answer your questions,” replied the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
civilly enough; “but if you follow me, you’ll perhaps
learn all you want to know.”</p>

<p>“Diplomacy!” whispered the Professor. “Let
me again urge diplomacy.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mortimer, sheathing his sword;
“let’s see this farce through to the end.”</p>

<p>They accordingly fell in on either side of their
conductor, who led the way for some little distance
down the valley, abruptly turning to the right into a
broad, deep cañon. Packed in the cañon in long
rows and heaps were what appeared to be quantities
of stores covered with huge tarpaulins. Here and
there were large, cave-like openings in the sides of
the hill, with men passing in and out. It was evidently
an extensive encampment and these cave-like
openings either led into quarters for the men, or
were storing places for more material.</p>

<p>The most astonishing spectacle of all presented itself
at the further end of the cañon, where a big,
roughly-built, black-bearded man, dressed in buck-skin
and broad-brimmed felt hat, a leather belt about
his waist and drawn sword in hand, was drilling a
squad of men. A short distance away was a large
tent, with a smaller one on either side.</p>

<p>As soon as he perceived the three approaching,
the man in command of the squad gave an order to a
subordinate and advanced toward them. He stopped
when some twenty paces away and motioned to
the man in charge of the two prisoners to approach.
The latter did so and in a low tone made his report,
whereupon the leader turned abruptly upon his heel
and made his way to the central tent. The man who
had been conducting Mortimer and Dean returned
to them.</p>

<p>“You’re to go before the Colonel,” he said.</p>

<p>“The Colonel!” exclaimed Mortimer, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
guffaw. “Colonel of what? May I inquire what
regiment this is?”</p>

<p>“Ask that of the Colonel,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“At least tell us the name of this Colonel?”</p>

<p>Their conductor hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“You may call him Colonel Henry,” he said.</p>

<p>“And you? You bear the rank of Captain, it
seems. How may we address you?”</p>

<p>“I am second in command here and you may call
me Captain Robert.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!” exclaimed Mortimer with sarcasm;
“an un-uniformed body of men, whose officers all
seem to be known by their first names. I’ll be much
interested to discover the nature of this organization.”</p>

<p>“Traitors are apt to turn up in every cause,” was
the grave answer, “although this cause has never
known one so far. Hence it’s wise to take every precaution.”</p>

<p>“Cause—what cause?” inquired Mortimer.</p>

<p>“No more questions, please,” answered Captain
Robert. “I bear you no ill-will and I want to give
you a word of friendly advice. Speak to the Colonel
softly and civilly. He’s a hard man at times and it
will be well to remember you are in his power.”</p>

<p>Mortimer was about to reply, but the Professor
hastily interposed.</p>

<p>“I take your advice in the spirit in which it is
given,” he said, “and I thank you.”</p>

<p>Captain Robert led the way to the central tent,
ushered in his two prisoners and retired. As he
did so, a squad of six men, armed with rifles, fell into
line behind Dean and Mortimer. The latter found
themselves confronted with Colonel Henry, who was
seated before a large table facing the entrance to the
tent.</p>

<p>“Your names,” he asked curtly, with a scowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“I’m Captain Mortimer, of the Imperial Guard,
and this is Professor Dean,” was Mortimer’s reply.
“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Since when have prisoners taken to doing the
questioning?” asked the other, with an ugly sneer.</p>

<p>“Prisoners!” retorted Mortimer, scornfully, “to
whom—to what authority?”</p>

<p>“Yes, prisoners!” was the answer with rising
fury, “and if you’ve any doubt on that score, I’ll
soon convince you of the fact.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment and calmed himself with an
effort.</p>

<p>“You are prisoners,” he continued, “just as the
rest of the Imperial Guard will be soon—prisoners
or dead.”</p>

<p>Captain Mortimer laughed derisively. Trained in
the roughness of service in camp and field, he was no
great adept in the milder methods of diplomacy and
the soft answer that turneth away wrath.</p>

<p>“Since when did you escape from safe-keeping?”
he asked contemptuously.</p>

<p>Henry rose to his feet, his face flushed with anger.</p>

<p>“You may laugh,” he cried, “but what I say is
true. They’ll all be prisoners, or dead!”</p>

<p>Mortimer shrugged his shoulders, with the air of
a man who declines to pursue an utterly nonsensical
proposition further.</p>

<p>“Enough,” exclaimed Henry. “What I want to
know is where you got that air-ship?”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to find out,” replied Mortimer.</p>

<p>“And I will,” retorted Henry, with growing anger.
“That air-ship was stolen from one of our camps.
There’s been a traitor somewhere and that traitor I
propose to discover.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Yes; if I have to drag the secret out of you by
main force.”</p>

<p>“You certainly stand an excellent chance of doing
it!” sneered Mortimer. “This much I’ll tell
you, though, so that no innocent person may possibly
come under suspicion: The air-ship is not stolen
property. It was built by an honest man and is the
property of His Majesty, the King.”</p>

<p>A look of mingled astonishment, incredulity and
anger came into Henry’s face as Mortimer spoke. At
the closing words he startled perceptibly.</p>

<p>“You lie!” he cried.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash of light, Mortimer’s long, sinewy
arm shot across the table and closed upon the other’s
throat. Henry was a big, strongly-built man, but
struggle as he would he could not free himself from
that vise-like grasp. Over went table and chair, and
back they staggered to the side of the tent, Mortimer’s
death-like grip neither shaken nor loosened. In an
instant Henry’s men recovered from the first shock
of surprise and the whole file rushed in to the rescue
of their chief. The shouts of the men and the sounds
of strife reached the outside of the tent and other
men, headed by Captain Robert, rushed in and lent
their aid. The struggle was sharp but brief and,
overborne by numbers, Mortimer was finally dragged
away, a stout rope wound about his arms. Dean,
too, they seized and secured.</p>

<p>Henry had been thrown down in the struggle. He
rose to his feet, black in the face and gasping, and
staggered against the side of the tent, his hands
pressed to his throat. Some of the men stood
bunched around Mortimer, to restrain any further
outbreak; others busied themselves picking up the
various articles scattered around the floor in the struggle.
Recovered somewhat from the fearful choking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Henry walked across the tent, his face working with
anger. He confronted Mortimer, standing bound
amid his captors.</p>

<p>“Curse you!”</p>

<p>And he struck the prisoner with his open hand full
across the face.</p>

<p>The blow was a heavy one and would have taken
a weaker man off his feet. A great shiver of rage
convulsed Mortimer’s powerful frame, he strained
furiously at his bonds and his blue eyes blazed with
fury as he glared into the dark face of his opponent.</p>

<p>“You hound! Should we ever meet face to face,
you’ll pay for that with your life!” he muttered between
his teeth.</p>

<p>A furious retort was upon the lips of Henry, when
Captain Robert abruptly interposed.</p>

<p>“You dare to interfere!” cried Henry, beside
himself.</p>

<p>“No, but—” and Captain Robert whispered, his
face close to that of his chief. The bystanders caught
only the words “treatment of prisoners,” “general
orders” and “High President.”</p>

<p>“Enough!” broke in Henry, with a violent effort
keeping down his rage. “Take him away. I’ll deal
with him later. Take him away, I say, before I kill
him where he stands!”</p>

<small>VALERIE SEEKS NEWS OF THE FASHIONS</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Robert lost no time in carrying out the
order thus received to remove the prisoners. Placing
himself between them, he marched from the tent
and hurried down the cañon.</p>

<p>“I warned you to take matters quietly,” he said
reproachfully. “Yet you seem to have acted like
a keg of explosives from the moment you got inside
the tent.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could find myself face to face with that
scoundrel, man to man, for a few minutes!” retorted
Mortimer. “Oh, for a company of the Guards at
my back at this moment and I’d soon teach that fellow
and those behind him here a lesson. Prisoners
or dead he said they would be shortly. I’d show him
that these same Guards were very much alive!”</p>

<p>“Prisoners or dead, eh?” repeated Robert. “Did
he tell you that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mortimer impatiently.</p>

<p>“He spoke only the truth,” said Robert solemnly.</p>

<p>Dean started. This was the second time within a
few minutes he had heard this declaration and the
man who now uttered it spoke earnestly and with conviction.
In Mortimer the words created nothing
save irritation and impatience. The idea of a body
of bandits, or other ruffians, talking of annihilating
the famous Guards—one of the crack regiments of
the world. It was too preposterous!</p>

<p>“Are you afflicted, too?” he asked with contempt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
“But never mind that! What’s this body of men
here? We are at least entitled to know to whom we
are prisoners.”</p>

<p>They had come to the end of the cañon and had
reached the main valley. Robert led in sharp turn
to the right and kept along parallel with the base of
the mountain.</p>

<p>“I may not answer your questions,” he replied,
“but unless I am much mistaken, there will shortly
arrive here one high in authority with whom you will
talk. This air-ship of yours must be reported at
once. It is the most momentous thing which could
have happened.”</p>

<p>“Why so? And who is this one high in authority
of whom you speak?” asked Mortimer.</p>

<p>Robert parried his question with the query:</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell me where you got your air-ship?
Did you secure it from one of our camps?”</p>

<p>“That ruffian back there has already asked me
that,” replied Mortimer, “and I told him that it
wasn’t stolen, as he seemed to think, from any of
your people, but was the legitimate property of His
Majesty, the King.”</p>

<p>“Then it was sold to the royalists by some renegade
of our party,” exclaimed Robert excitedly.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Mortimer. “There you’re
quite wrong.”</p>

<p>“Who built it, then? Have you any more such
ships?” continued Robert with the same avidity.</p>

<p>“Steady, now!” replied Mortimer, smiling at the
other’s eagerness. “You’re not particularly liberal
in the matter of information and we’re not generous,
either,” he added with sarcasm, “after the treatment
we have experienced here.”</p>

<p>“For that,” replied Robert humbly, “I ask your
pardon in my behalf and in behalf of many others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
here who will learn and not approve of what has been
done. The Colonel is a hard man—a brutal man,
if you will—but a highly capable one. Hence he
is in command here. Blood will have to be shed so
that our cause may prevail, but the great mass of us
are, I may truly say, opposed to any unnecessary
violence.”</p>

<p>“You speak strangely,” said Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may so seem to you,” replied Robert,
“but it’s nevertheless true. When the hour comes
we shall strike, to the full extent that may be necessary,
but not one step beyond that. Those are the
orders—the orders of the High President.”</p>

<p>“The High President!” exclaimed Mortimer,
coming to a dead stop. “Ah! I see—I see! I’ve
heard that title before. This—this—camp is a
camp of Reactionists and you—you—you—are
rebels—conspirators against the King!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Robert warningly.</p>

<p>“You deny it!” cried Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I affirm or deny nothing!” replied Robert.
“I’ve already said too much. Come, let us move
on.” He touched Mortimer lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>They walked a short distance further on down the
valley, to a large circular opening between the mountains,
where a singular sight confronted them. In
that great circular valley, moored to right and left,
like shipping in a harbor, lay some two dozen air-ships
of varying sizes. In the foremost rank were
the four great ships which had effected their capture,
and nestling behind these four was their own craft,
the “Royal Dean.” Here and there men at work
were moving about among the ships.</p>

<p>Silently they stared for a moment upon the scene
before them.</p>

<p>“I would much like to inspect some of these,”
whispered Dean to Robert. “May I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“I hardly think I have authority to grant you that
privilege,” replied Robert, smiling, “but <i>your</i> ship
will doubtless be subjected to very careful scrutiny
by us. By the way, is there anything about it that
requires attention for the moment?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Dean; “everything is automatically
controlled and it can remain as it is for a
month without injury.”</p>

<p>“Did you take part in fitting it up?” asked Robert
curiously.</p>

<p>“For any and all information,” replied Dean, with
a laugh, “I must refer you to Captain Mortimer.”</p>

<p>Robert good-naturedly joined in the laugh against
himself and led the way on board one of the larger
air-ships. This air-ship was supplied with quite a
spacious cabin and into this cabin Robert showed his
prisoners, unbinding the ropes which confined their
arms.</p>

<p>“This will have to be your dungeon cell for the
present,” he said, with a wave of the hand around the
cabin, “and I think you will agree it might be worse.
For my part, I’ll do all in my power to make you as
comfortable as possible. We have a very fair commissariat
department, I think you’ll find, and I’ll at
least see to it that you’re well looked after in that direction.
My quarters are quite close to yours and
whatever is prepared for my daughter and myself you
shall share.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter,” repeated Mortimer. “Was
that the lady whom we saw when we landed?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Robert; “my only child. The organization
here sought me because of my knowledge
of mechanics which rendered me useful in connection
with these air-ships. I would never have consented
to come, though, if it had meant separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
from my girl, so they agreed to her coming with
me. She’s a great favorite here. They call her
‘The Daughter of the Regiment.’ But, while I
am talking away to you, I expect you are pretty
hungry.”</p>

<p>“I confess to experiencing a sense of vacuum,”
said the Professor.</p>

<p>“I’m as hungry as a bear,” said Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Then your wants in that respect shall be quickly
supplied,” replied Robert cheerily. “In the meantime
you’ll forgive me, I know, if I secure this door
on the outside and put a man on guard. That’s the
usual military process, I believe, Captain?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Mortimer, with a laugh.
“I promise you not to escape during the next hour—not
until after breakfast.”</p>

<p>“And your sword,” said Robert, glancing at the
scabbard which hung by Mortimer’s side. “I suppose,
according to strict military rule, I ought to demand
that you give it up.”</p>

<p>Mortimer’s face darkened.</p>

<p>“I served through the Russian war,” he said, “and
was never taken prisoner. To yield up my sword
would be a new experience to me. I’ll yield it to
none here, and those who would have it must take it
by force.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Robert in a conciliatory tone,
“we needn’t quarrel over that. We hold you securely
enough here as it is and can afford to leave you
your sword.”</p>

<p>With these words, he stepped from the cabin, secured
the door on the outside and the two prisoners
were alone. Instinctively they turned and faced each
other.</p>

<p>“A pretty mess we’ve made of it!” exclaimed
Mortimer, with a laugh. “We started out to capture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
those fellows and here they’ve turned the tables and
captured us. A nice little ambuscade we’ve walked,
or rather flown, into. The worst of it, too, is that I
thought it was only a night’s work and I didn’t even
get leave of absence from the Guard—all of which
is quite an infraction of military discipline.”</p>

<p>“And I,” bewailed the Professor, “what a mess
I’ve made of it! Never once in the excitement of
the chase did I think of using the aërestograph to
communicate with our friend Kearns. You see, I
was kept pretty busy handling the air-ship and keeping
watch on the movements of the fellows in front
of us. Still, I suppose I ought to have managed to
send him a message or two.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Mortimer; “you were not
to blame. Up to the moment of our capture what
news was there to send? We were every moment
awaiting developments.”</p>

<p>“And when those developments occurred,” remarked
the Professor dryly, “it was no longer in our
power to send messages.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” assented Mortimer, “but all that
happened was so utterly unlooked for that we could
hardly have been expected to foresee it. Those who
are disposed to criticise may be reminded of the old
axiom that foresight is never equal to hindsight.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” answered the Professor, “but what
can you suggest as the best way out of our present
position? What shall we do?”</p>

<p>There was a sound at the door, as of someone at
work on the outer fastenings.</p>

<p>“Nothing—until after breakfast,” replied Mortimer.
“Ah, here it comes, I think—and welcome.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the door opened and there appeared,
at the head of the steps leading down into the cabin,
the graceful figure of a girl carrying a large tray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
substantially laden with food. At a glance they recognized
her as she whom they had seen upon landing.</p>

<p>Professor Dean rose and bowed.</p>

<p>“Miss Robert, I believe?” said Captain Mortimer,
also rising and bowing.</p>

<p>The girl deposited her heavy tray, ran over to a
locker and procured a white tablecloth which she
spread upon the table.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, with a merry laugh, “but
here in the camp they call me ‘Valerie.’”</p>

<p>And she turned a pair of merry brown eyes upon
them, eyes that rested with evident admiration on
Mortimer’s jaunty military jacket, with its gay trappings.
As she stood there smiling, with her high
color, her jet-black hair, her graceful figure, and
large but very white teeth showing between her full,
scarlet lips, she was unquestionably a very pretty
girl.</p>

<p>“Valerie,” repeated Mortimer, gallantly. “That
is certainly a very pretty name, but a rather uncommon
one in this country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Valerie, still laughing, as she
busied herself with the table; “I suppose it is. My
mother was French and I was named after her.
They tell me you come direct from the palace,” she
prattled on. “Are any of the ladies there called
Valerie?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” replied Mortimer, joining in her
merry mood. “It would be hard, even at Court, to
find a name as pretty as that.”</p>

<p>“And is it true that the ladies are wearing dresses
cut in Directoire style?” continued Valerie.</p>

<p>Mortimer broke into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “I am not competent to answer
that. Perhaps,” he added mischievously, “my
friend Professor Dean, who takes a great interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
in the ladies, can inform you upon that subject.”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the Professor fairly blushed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he stammered confusedly, “I don’t know
much about ladies’ dresses, but it is true that the
fashions have reverted to something like that which
was in vogue some two centuries ago and the ladies
at the Court to-day are wearing dresses which suggest
those of the days of the French <i>Directoire</i>.”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Mortimer triumphantly.
“You see he is an authority and I referred you to
the right source for information.”</p>

<p>“It must be a very pretty fashion,” remarked the
girl musingly. “How I would like to see those
dresses—and the Court and the ladies there!
What a pity it seems that a Court is wicked and must
be done away with.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think the Court is wicked?”
asked Mortimer curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the girl, “I have always been
taught that. Everybody here says it is. But I am
keeping you from your breakfast,” she added, hastily.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” protested Mortimer and the Professor
together. “Pray stay.”</p>

<p>“No; I must go,” she replied regretfully. “I
was specially told I must not talk much to you and
if I stay too long, father will suspect and not let me
come again, and,” she added with a saucy smile and
a final admiring glance at Mortimer’s uniform, as
she fled up the steps, “I <i>want</i> to come again.”</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her the Professor turned
to Mortimer.</p>

<p>“They say that every woman is at heart a royalist
and I verily believe this very attractive young woman
has a leaning that way.”</p>

<p>“The saying is a very true one,” replied Mortimer.
“From what little I have read and observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
on the subject, I should say that the women—God
bless them!—had much to do, by indirect but nevertheless
powerful influence, with the formation of the
monarchy, and womankind to-day is to be reckoned
as one of the staunchest supports of the throne.”</p>

<p>And with this summary of the situation, he turned
with interest to the breakfast before them.</p>

<p>They spent the remainder of the morning and
afternoon in arguing over various measures and plans
of escape. There was a sentinel, they knew, constantly
on duty outside the cabin door, and should
they break out and confront this man there were
doubtless plenty of his comrades at hand to come to
his assistance before an escape could be made. From
what little they had seen of the valley they had
perceived that it was apparently enclosed on all sides
by high, precipitous mountains, which would take
much time and effort to scale and would afford excellent
opportunities for pursuit and recapture. Any
clumsy and unsuccessful effort at escape would naturally
lead to greater vigilance on the part of their
captors. They were both agreed that they must be
patient for the moment and watch for some favorable
opportunity before venturing an attempt.</p>

<p>Their dinner was brought them by Valerie, who
stayed longer than before, chatting gayly and coquetting
at a lively rate with Mortimer. After dinner
they received a visit from Captain Robert, who came
with a bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>“I cannot offer you cigars,” he said, “for there is
a shortage of those luxuries here, but I can give you
some excellent tobacco.” He took the bundle from
under his arm and laid upon the table some long clay
pipes and a stone jar filled with tobacco.</p>

<p>“There’s a great consumption of pipes among our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
people,” he said, “and we manufacture these ourselves—both
the long and the short variety.”</p>

<p>The Professor smiled.</p>

<p>“You seem to have extensive facilities for various
kinds of manufacturing,” he remarked with meaning.</p>

<p>Captain Robert laughed outright.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to give you any information on
that point,” he said, “but I can tell you something
of interest.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“The news of your capture and of your air-ship,”
continued Captain Robert, “has been forwarded to
headquarters and it seems to have made, as I predicted,
quite a stir.”</p>

<p>“Ah! is that all!” answered the Professor, with
some disappointment.</p>

<p>“By no means,” replied Robert. “A certain important
personage is on his way here. To-morrow
you will receive a visit.”</p>

<p>“From whom?” inquired Dean curiously.</p>

<p>The other dropped his voice to a whisper:</p>

<p>“From the High President himself!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE MASKED VISITOR</small></h3>
</div>

<p>It was close upon noon on the following day when
Captain Robert presented himself before the prisoners.
He was eager and excited.</p>

<p>“Are you ready to receive the visit I spoke of last
night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Mortimer, with a slight show
of interest, “is His Mightiness, your famous High
President, here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Robert; “he arrived just before
daylight and has been busy during the morning
around the camp.”</p>

<p>“Arrived before daylight!” repeated Mortimer.
“Your High President is an early traveler.”</p>

<p>“Those who come to this camp,” answered Robert
gravely, “invariably arrive before daylight. I don’t
think I’ll betray any very special information if I
tell you in confidence that he was picked up at a
distant point from here and arrived by air-ship.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I surmised when you first
spoke,” said Dean quickly.</p>

<p>“Then your surmise was quite correct,” replied
Robert. “He arrived and he will leave by air-ship.
Are you ready to receive him?”</p>

<p>Mortimer and the Professor both assented and
Robert started for the cabin steps. But he stopped
and again turned to them.</p>

<p>“I know nothing definitely,” he said, “but I
strongly suspect the interview you are about to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
will be a most important one. I have your welfare
at heart. I beg you to receive the High President
in the right spirit and to give due heed to his words.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said the Professor appreciatively.</p>

<p>“And I thank you,” exclaimed Mortimer, “but
I’ve already had one unpleasant experience here.
Your High President shall be received by us with
due consideration and we will listen carefully to
whatever he may have to say to us, provided the
manner and language adopted are such as may be
properly tolerated by a gentleman of the high scientific
attainments of my friend, Professor Dean, and
myself, as an officer of His Majesty, the King.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed Robert enthusiastically, “you
need have no fear on that score. Don’t for a moment
compare the High President with anyone you have
seen here. The High President is a man of the
highest culture and of the highest calibre. He is
the most God-like man who has lived since the days
of Washington—a leader gifted with genius for
organization, a patriot who seeks nothing except for
his countrymen; brave, enterprising, resourceful,
merciless when the occasion demands it, yet with a
heart full of love for humanity—such is our High
President. He will go down to posterity as the
greatest patriot and leader of men of the centuries.”</p>

<p>Robert’s eyes blazed with enthusiasm as he spoke
and his manner was full of earnestness.</p>

<p>“We will bear your words in mind,” said the Professor.
“He is doubtless very worthy, since you estimate
him so highly.”</p>

<p>“And you—what say you?” asked Robert, turning
questioningly to Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I can hardly be expected to subscribe to your
views,” answered Mortimer coldly, “inasmuch as I
have reason to suspect the person to whom you refer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
to be engaged in an organized and armed rebellion
against the government and to be an enemy to the
King.”</p>

<p>Robert stood for a moment looking sadly into Mortimer’s
face and then, without another word, withdrew.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later the door again opened
and looking up they saw Robert. He stepped back,
opened the door to its fullest extent and there appeared
a man tall of stature and of massive physique.
With movements which were remarkably rapid for
one of such giant proportions, he passed down the
cabin steps and stood before them.</p>

<p>Both Mortimer and Dean looked up with a start
of astonishment.</p>

<p>Their visitor was masked.</p>

<p>“Greeting!” he exclaimed, as he stood facing
them, using the common form of salutation of the
day. Long ago the Professor had duly noted that
the comparatively meaningless “Good-morning!”
and “Good-day!” of the olden times had passed into
disuse; as had also that almost pathetic expression
at parting: “Good-bye!” They were as obsolete
as the “Good-morrow!” of the eighteenth century.
People now said “Greeting!” or “Salutations!” or
“I salute you!” when they met and “Re-meeting!”
when they parted—thereby intending to courteously
convey the idea that they looked forward with anticipation
and pleasure to again meeting the person
from whom they were taking leave. “To our joyous
re-meeting!” Surely a happier salutation than the
old-time sad “Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“We greet you!” responded Mortimer, in turn
using the customary form of salutation.</p>

<p>“I trust you have been well cared for,” continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
the visitor, “and that your detention has been made
as comfortable as circumstances would permit.”</p>

<p>“With the exception of a dastardly insult received
from him who appears to be in chief command here,”
replied Mortimer, flushing with anger at the recollections
of the event, “we have received every kindness
and courtesy.”</p>

<p>The visitor waved his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“The matter has been reported to me,” he said,
“and you may rely upon it that I have severely
reprimanded the offender. Only the existence of an
extraordinary exigency has prevented the summary
removal of the officer. Such action, I beg to assure
you, is entirely contrary to the spirit and rules of
our organization.”</p>

<p>“Then I accept your explanation,” answered
Mortimer. “I’ll only hold the man himself responsible
for his act. Let us put that matter aside and
pass on to other subjects. I wish to know what is
this organization assembled here that has dared to
hold in detention my friend and myself, both in the
service of His Majesty, the King.”</p>

<p>The visitor threw back his head proudly and answered
without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“You may have experienced some reticence on that
subject from those about you,” he said, “for it is
well that subordinates should be trained to caution
and to secrecy, but I have no hesitation in satisfying
your inquiry. You are prisoners by the right of
Might—the paramount right in the affairs of this
world—and the body to which you are prisoners
is the Federated Nihilists of America.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Nihilists!” exclaimed Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply; “commonly but very inaccurately
referred to by you of the Court as ‘Reactionists.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“And you,” said Mortimer; “you are the High
President?”</p>

<p>“I am the High President.”</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause and Mortimer again
spoke.</p>

<p>“Then, may I ask of you,” he said, “as the head
of this organization, what are your plans concerning
us? Is this detention to last indefinitely, or have
you any terms to offer us?”</p>

<p>“Let us be seated,” answered the High President.
“I have much to say to you and much may depend
upon our conference. I see that you have smoking
materials on the table. Pray smoke, if it please you,
and if you think it will add calmness and wisdom to
our deliberations.”</p>

<p>Professor Dean had thus far not uttered a single
word. There was a strange straining and puzzling
going on in his mind. Certain accents in the voice
of the High President struck upon his ear with a
strange familiarity. Where before had he heard
that voice? Was it among some of those whom he
had recently met, or was it merely a resemblance
conveying a suggestion of his former life—of the
long ago?</p>

<p>They took their seats about the table and faced
each other for a moment. Then the High President
spoke.</p>

<p>“As I have told you,” he said, “this body is known
as the Federated Nihilists of America—a body
which you, Captain Mortimer, have doubtless now
and again vaguely heard referred to as ‘The Reactionists.’
Nothing could be more inaccurate, or misleading,
than this term, inasmuch as the entire spirit
of our organization is directly opposed to reaction.
The royalists call us ‘Reactionists’ because they believe
our aim is to upset the monarchical establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and revert to the former Republic. Nothing
could be more wrong, and I say to you frankly that
between the Monarchy of to-day and the old-time
Republic, as it existed prior to the crowning of the
first American King, the Monarchy is the better institution.”</p>

<p>“If you admit that,” said Mortimer argumentatively,
“what is it you seek to attain?”</p>

<p>“That which the title of our organization implies,”
replied the High President. “We style ourselves
Nihilists and, as you know, the word Nihil
is from the Latin and signifies ‘Nothing.’ First, existing
institutions must be wiped out—reduced to
nothing—before we can build up the new. Our
aim is to extinguish—to annihilate—to destroy—not
only the existing monarchy, not only all relics and
customs which have been handed down to us from the
Republic preceding that monarchy, but all existing
institutions. We regard these existing institutions as
so unsatisfactory, so corrupt, so vile that it would be
a useless task to seek to better them. You will never
reach a given point, no matter how you may press
onward or take turns to the right or to the left, if
you are on entirely the wrong road. So it is with
existing institutions. The conditions are so utterly
and hopelessly wrong that it is a useless task to seek
to improve them. The only recourse is to wipe everything
out and build up entirely anew.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that idea formulated in Russia a long
time ago?” asked Mortimer thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“The idea was agitated in Russia over a century
ago,” replied the High President, “and its advocates
prosecuted in a more or less crude and barbarous
fashion their ideas and their plans. It does not follow
that because an idea is old, it is devoid of merit.
On the contrary, nearly all the great ideas and movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
in this world have been in existence a long time—have
been old—before the world has finally accepted
them. The soil of Russia, however, never
was a suitable soil for the cultivation of the plant
of Liberty. Here in the broad, free American air,
Liberty will flourish and give to mankind a new and
happier era. Our Nihilism, while founded upon the
same basic principle, is in its practical workings upon
a far more scientific foundation. It is a Nihilism
brought down to the requirements and the civilization
of the twentieth century.”</p>

<p>“And you really think this Nihilism of yours,
with its Russian origin and its later-day modifications
and improvements as worked out by you, better for
the American people than the Monarchy?” asked
Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” answered the High President.
“The American atmosphere and the genius of the
American people are not really suited to a monarchy,
although thanks to the trend of peculiar circumstances
those forces here which favor that form of government—and
I will admit they are by no means few
or lacking in influence and power—have for the time
being the upper hand. The real mission, however,
of Americans, with all their faults and foibles, is to
teach the world at large new and greater forms of
liberty and human happiness, ever growing grander
and greater throughout the successive cycles of time.”</p>

<p>“And you think your Nihilism better suited for
the American people than a republic, such as that
which was supplanted by the present Monarchy?”
said Professor Dean, who had been an attentive
listener and who now for the first time joined in the
conversation. “Ah, sir, I have heard you refer with
striking disparagement to that Republic. I would
gladly have you give some reasons for these views!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Bah!” exclaimed the High President contemptuously,
“the old-time Republic, eh! Could anything
more evil, corrupt, hypocritical, farcical and
criminal exist under the sun than that old-time Republic
of yours? All modern thinkers, writers and
sociologists are agreed as to that. You have heard
me say that of the two the present monarchy was the
better institution, and I spoke advisedly.”</p>

<p>“What—what!” stammered the Professor, fairly
taken aback at the directness and violence of the attack.
“Your reasons, sir—your reasons!”</p>

<p>“Reasons?” repeated the High President. “They
will not be hard to give. To-day we have only one
King. He is great and rich and powerful, so much
so that he need seek no further self-advantages but
may rest content with all that which is his. He need
have an eye only to the welfare of his nation and his
people. We have an aristocracy, too; also great and
rich, so much so that they can well afford to lay self-interest
aside and seek public life with a view solely
to the greater glory of their country. There are exceptions
to this, of course, but I speak of our aristocracy
as a class. Then, too, our aristocrats of to-day
have been aristocrats for a sufficient time to be
at least free from the shortcomings, the arrogance
and the vices which have ever marked the <i>parvenu</i>.
Now let us look at the old-time Republic!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” exclaimed the Professor, bending forward
in his eagerness.</p>

<p>“The old-time Republic,” continued the High
President, “had not one king but many. You had
not a monarch—serene and majestic, clothed in the
royal purple, bearing the sceptre and crown and surrounded
by the glitter and the glory of an imperial
court. Instead, the land was divided up among a
parcel of little rulers—men mostly of low origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
and ignoble ideals—who really exercised kingly
power. Take your proud Empire State of New
York—a state as broad, as rich and as populous as
some of the great empires of Europe. Two little
kings reigned there—the one, a small, shrivelled,
old man who divided his time between the handling
of parcels and the pulling of political wires; the
other a beetle-browed, sullen ruler, whose brutal
hands, reeking with crime and corruption, were ever
stretched forth to grasp further plunder.”</p>

<p>“By heaven!” exclaimed Mortimer, “was it really
as bad as that!”</p>

<p>“I am quoting to you almost literally from the
chronicles of the times,” replied the High President.
“These two little kings absolutely ruled the state between
them. It was at their royal behest that governors
were nominated and elected, legislators selected
and judges put upon the bench. When any
opposition to their respective rules appeared to
threaten them, they promptly joined forces, fought
shoulder to shoulder and, under prearranged agreement,
divided the subsequent plunder. Behind them
was an armed banditti of many thousand men, known
as a police force and supposed to be organized for the
protection and enforcement of law and order. As
a matter of fact, this force was nothing less than an
organized body of ravishers and despoilers, preying
upon the people and levying tribute right and left.
It is safe to say that the operations of all the banditti
since the beginning of the Christian era, nor any invading
army, ever equaled in the amount of loot
secured the operations of the force I speak of which
stood behind these two kings.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” exclaimed Mortimer; “things must
have been pretty bad in your Republic, Professor!”</p>

<p>Dean lowered his eyes as one who is ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“There is much that is correct in all this,” he
said; “much that I cannot truthfully contradict.
But proceed.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and proceed I will,” replied the High President
stoutly. “The aristocracy which surrounded
these kings—that is, the men who formed their
courts and helped to administer the public affairs—were
in many instances vulgar publicans; men who
derived their incomes by the maintenance of groggeries
and low dancing houses, or worse—gamblers,
touts, and a sprinkling of ex-convicts and little lawyers.
Such was the aristocracy and the environment
of these kings—the men who really ruled the land.
I have spoken so far of the proud Empire State of
New York. If you turn to the East or to the South,
the middle country or the West, you will find that
much the same conditions prevailed. Deny it, if
you can!”</p>

<p>“I think,” protested the Professor, “that your
criticism is, perhaps, directed into too narrow channels
and that it treats too much of certain phases of
mere partisan, or local politics.”</p>

<p>“But was not each State sovereign and independent,”
retorted the High President, “and did not each
State make its own laws and govern itself generally?
Then, too, how was the Federal government itself
made up except from the combined selections of the
different States?”</p>

<p>“Still,” persisted the Professor, “I think that your
criticism might be directed toward more broad and
general conditions of our national life.”</p>

<p>“That, too, I will do since you have demanded it,”
replied the High President. “Let us go back to the
days of almost primeval man. What did the chief
of the tribe, or band, do? He parcelled out the best
of the plunder, or possessions, among his strongest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
fighting men, or else among the priests, or medicine
men, or whoever was equally powerful with the fighting
men in his particular way. Take it again in
feudal England. What did the feudal Kings do there
after the Norman Conquest? They divided the best
lands of the country among the powerful Barons who
formed their Court. And so it was in your Republic.
The good things of the land—the great public
franchises—were all parcelled out to these modern
feudal Barons who waxed fat and built their wealth
into the millions upon that which had been given
them at the expense of the people.”</p>

<p>“But there were, I remember, various objections
raised,” said the Professor, “to any other course being
adopted—such as government ownership.”</p>

<p>“Objections!” exclaimed the High President contemptuously;
“objections can be raised to anything.
The murderer doubtless has his objections to the gallows
and the thief strongly objects to the jail. There
was at least one shining example of government
ownership in those days. Was there anything so reliable
or so admirably administered as the public
mails—entirely conducted by the government?
How is it possible in a true Republic to contemplate
that which belongs to the public being given away for
the benefit and enrichment of the few and the public
correspondingly robbed to that extent.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” remarked the Professor, “in spite of
these criticisms which you make, it seemed to be generally
admitted that our people under the Republic
had better reason to be contented than the people of
any other nation on the face of the globe.”</p>

<p>“And so they had the right to expect to be,” retorted
the High President, “but surely what you
advance is no argument. Ought the people here to
be satisfied merely because they are comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
better off than the people of Scandinavia and the people
of Scandinavia in turn be well content because
they are comparatively better off than the people of
the interior of China? But let us look further into
the question as to how well the people under the Republic
were contented. Were they really contented,
or did they individually accept existing conditions
because they could discover no particular way of
changing them? Do you think that the average man
among the great masses of the people was satisfied
to work all his life for a pittance which was insufficient
in most instances to fully furnish him, year in
and year out, with the actual necessaries of life and
see another man, of the same clay as himself, who
could afford to squander aimlessly in one day upon an
old bit of cracked porcelain, a piece of painted canvas,
or some drab of the footlights, whose complexion
was as false as her soul, as much money as that other
man earned in a lifetime. And yet the one man was,
perhaps, fully as well endowed physically and mentally
as the other and the life work of the one was
fully as useful to the community as the work of the
other. Why, then, this awful disparity? Do you
know, too, that statistics show that of ten adults dying
under your vaunted Republic, nine went out of this
world subjects for Potter’s Field? I do not mean
by this that they were actually so interred, for the
love and respect of friends who lent their aid usually
saved them from this, but I do mean that nine
out of ten died without leaving sufficient behind them,
after a lifetime of honest, unremitting toil, to actually
pay their burial expenses.”</p>

<p>“I was unaware of that,” said the Professor, “and
it certainly is a shocking disclosure.”</p>

<p>“Shocking, indeed!” retorted the High President.
“I do not think there is any disputing that. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
do you believe that the people were satisfied on the
land question? It does not require any great depth
of learning in political economy to know that the
source of all wealth is the land. All that which we
have is either taken from the earth, or else is grown
upon or fed from the surface of the earth. Is it to
be believed that God put the minerals, the oil, the
coal into the earth for the benefit of an exclusive few,
or that he put them there for the joint and common
benefit of the masses of mankind? Did He make
the surface of the earth fruitful and send the showers
and the sunshine, which alone enable it to fructify,
for the benefit of a chosen few, or for the common
benefit of all? That the former was the case seems
to have been the theory which prevailed under the Republic,
for we find that the great bulk of the land was
owned by the comparative few. Do you think the
masses of the great cities were individually satisfied
that acre upon acre of city blocks should be owned
by certain families to whom all those dwelling in
those blocks paid a heavy rent tribute year in, year
out—a tribute amounting upon an average from one-fourth
to one-third of the total income earned? What
substantial difference was there between this and
mediæval feudalism? And what did those land-cornerers
do with the vast surplus sums accumulated
from the tribute wrung from those rent slaves? The
chronicles show that they cast about them for communities
as yet in their incipiency but presenting possibilities
of growing into populous centres of activity.
In these growing communities, these land-gluttons
bought up the best portions of realty, which they let
lie for the time being, unused and unimproved, paying
merely the low tax imposed upon unimproved
property. The community was built up by the enterprise,
the labor and the efforts of the masses; it grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
into a city and became populous; its land became valuable.
When their vacant lots had acquired value
through the efforts of the people—efforts in which
they had in no way participated—these land-cornerers
put up structures and proceeded with the old
game of levying the rent tribute. If ever there was
an instance of unjust enrichment, it was this.”</p>

<p>The Professor remained thoughtfully silent.</p>

<p>“Talk not to me of the old-time Republic,” continued
the High President; “it died because of its
innate rottenness—because of the apathy of its people—and
the littleness and corruption of its public
men. Look at the infamous record of your Food
Trusts, which forced up the prices of many articles
of food so that they were beyond the reach of the
great mass of the poorer people. Contemplate the
Coal Trust, whose directing powers first advanced,
under the Republic, the hitherto exclusively monarchical
claim of Divine Right, and proceeded to manipulate
the coal supply so that citizens of the Republic
were frozen to death, while thousands of unknown
and unrecorded others undoubtedly perished from
diseases incurred as a result of insufficient warmth.
The unfortunate poor might have derived a little
benefit by burning oil, but what did the eminent citizen
of that day do who, while not claiming to be
God’s anointed, yet had contrived to absorb all the
oil of the country? Why, he promptly took advantage
of the situation and raised the price of oil. It
is true that at the same time he, with reckless generosity,
contributed some ten thousand dollars to a
benevolent enterprise, but in the meantime he had
pocketed a cool million by the advancement of the
price of his commodity. Here was a million wrung
out of the sufferings of God’s poor and a sop of ten
thousand dollars thrown out to hoodwink and propitiate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the Almighty. What must have been the
Deity’s sentiments over this estimate of the financial
perspicacity which sought to deceive him by such
a ruse—a ruse which would have been apparent to
the intelligence of the dullest office-boy employed in
a commercial institution!”</p>

<p>“All those events were duly criticised at the time,”
murmured the Professor, “and came in for their
share of censure.”</p>

<p>“Criticism—censure!” exclaimed the High
President with disgust. “But what did the people
do? Did they seize upon those who withheld the food
and the warmth and rush them to public execution,
as did the people of France with their oppressing
nobles in the days of the great French Revolution?
No; they did nothing! They waited and stared and
suffered like dumb cattle driven to the shambles.
And the public men of the day? They conferred a
good deal and they even threatened a little, but—it
was a very respectful threatening in the face of
Mighty Capital. The Chief Magistrate of the Nation
in that day was a man still young—a man
strong, vigorous and bold, who had filled various
public offices ably and well and had proved himself
a brave soldier in the field. He was the people’s
idol and the people’s hope. There was food in plenty
to be had from other lands, but it was shut out from
the people’s use by an exorbitant protective tariff.
Remove this tariff and food would have flooded in
upon the people in boundless store and the corner in
Monopoly and Death have been crushed out of existence
in a week. Congress held the vested right to
do whatsoever might be necessary for the welfare or
safety of the people and a ringing message, couched
in his old-time, fearless form, from this Chief Magistrate
would have set the people throughout the length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
and breadth of the land ablaze with enthusiasm. It
would have put him beyond the power of any clique
or party, and would have exalted him to the highest
pinnacle of popular idolatry as the man of the hour,
the people’s choice! His party would not have dared
to say him nay, for individually and alone he would
have stood stronger than his party. It was an opportunity
such as rarely comes to a ruler. But the voice
of the cautious counselors surrounding him in his
exalted station whispered in his ear: ‘You have
been accused of being too bold, as lacking in conservatism.
Do not frighten, or attack, the great money
interests—those representing the sacred and vested
Rights of Capital—lest in their fear they turn and
destroy you!’ And he hearkened to this counsel. It
is true, I believe, that a measure was finally passed
temporarily admitting foreign coal free of tariff
charge, but this measure came too late. The President’s
brave heart bled for the people, but his old-time
fearlessness forsook him and he failed them.
And when he so failed them, the last hope of the Republic
went out. The Republic was doomed. The
shadows of Plutocracy and of Monarchy lowered over
the land!”</p>

<p>“And the Monarchy which came was an improvement,
you consider, upon the Republic which preceded?”
asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“At least in this respect,” answered the High
President, “that under a monarchy we may reasonably
look for class distinction, for great wealth on the
one side and for great poverty on the other, but in a
true Republic, one worthy of the name, such distinction
is as unnatural as it is iniquitous.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now you are about to criticise the Monarchy,
I suspect!” exclaimed Mortimer. “But, pray tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
me, is your Nihilism going to cure all these evils you
have portrayed?”</p>

<p>“You speak of Nihilism,” answered the High
President gravely, “as if it were the beginning and
end of the entire programme. As a matter of fact,
Nihilism is only the beginning. As I have told you,
we must first wipe out existing institutions so that
we may properly build up a new Commonwealth, or
Republic, founded upon the abolition of industrial
slavery, the brotherhood of man and the more equal
apportionment of benefits to the race.”</p>

<p>“But you spoke particularly of the evils of individual
land ownership,” persisted Mortimer.
“Would you under your scheme do away with that?”</p>

<p>“I undoubtedly would,” answered the High President.
“It seems to me a proposition beyond argument
that God created the land and all within it for
the benefit of mankind in general and not for the
benefit of a given few. The land should no more be
owned individually than the air, or the seas. It
should be the property of all and inure to the benefit
of all—in a word, belong to the State. Those using
land, either urban or agricultural, should lease from
the State and pay the rent tribute to the State and
the benefits of the land—created by God for all—would
thus inure to the benefit of all.”</p>

<p>“Would not this tend to accumulate,” suggested
the Professor, “too vast sums in the hands of the
State—sums so vast that there would constantly be a
stringency of money and a consequent business paralysis?”</p>

<p>“The answer to that,” replied the High President,
“is that the State could by magnificent public improvements
and in a hundred other ways find means
of rapidly disposing of any such surplus it might acquire.
It could, if necessary, pay out dividends to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
its citizens, as the big corporations do to their share-holders.
This objection you have advanced and a
thousand others, will ever be urged to any change
looking to an improvement of things. The people
thus opposing will be found describing their opposition
as Conservatism. The true definition of a Conservatism
is a man very well-off, who finds things pre-eminently
satisfactory for him as they are and is,
therefore, opposed to any change. Priestcraft, when
it held communities and nations under its subjection,
the feudal barons, emperors, kings and modern plutocrats—these,
all these, you will find to have been
staunch advocates of Conservatism. Did you ever
reflect,” continued the High President, “upon the
inequality and injustice of existing laws of property
ownership? When a man composes an opera, or
indites a book of poems, or writes a novel, or devises
some new and useful invention, he plays the part of a
creator. Out of his own brain alone that production
has evolved. It did not exist before he gave it birth
and the world is so much the richer. If ever a man
can be said to have a proprietary right in anything,
it is to that property which actually was evolved from
and created by himself alone. Yet, in the case of an
author, or composer, the Law protects him in that
property right for only twenty-eight years, and in the
case of the inventor for only seventeen years. After
that, their respective productions pass into the public
domain—become public property. But the man
who for a mere trifle acquires a tract, or parcel, of
land—which he certainly had no part in creating
or putting there—and holds it while a city builds
about him and the land is made valuable by the presence
and the efforts of the community at large—that
man owns that land in perpetuity; it is the property
of him and his heirs forever. And the Law itself!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
What a monstrous combination of illogical deduction
and of systematic injustice! The Law! Five years
required to adjudicate a case which would be sufficiently
disposed of in as many hours under any modern
system of businesslike administration—the Law
which can only be invoked under conditions of expense
absurdly disproportionate to the results. Just
think of a system which is supposed to adjudicate
and do substantial justice between man and man and
yet which nine men out of ten in the community will
tell you means ruin to resort to! The Law in its
methods of procedure is a century, or more, behind
the times and the learned and time-honored profession
of the Law is, in reality, the profession of the modern
highwayman. There is no form of modern evil
which more seriously demands the application of the
principles of Nihilism than the Law as it to-day exists!”</p>

<p>“And if your New Republic could be established,”
asked Mortimer, “you would be in favor of
ruthlessly despoiling all the present land owners of
their holdings and escheating these holdings to the
State?”</p>

<p>“That need not necessarily be done,” answered the
High President. “It would be no very difficult matter
to assess the land at a fair valuation and for the
State to pay to the owners thereof a given annual
percentage for say fifty years to come, subject to certain
qualifications. This would result in eventually
reimbursing to the owners far more than they had
originally expended and would give them ample time
to accommodate themselves to the new condition of
things. Of course, manifold objections, both technical
and financial, will be urged to the feasibility of
this plan—especially by those with tendencies to
Conservatism—but I apprehend there are no obstacles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
to its successful execution which cannot be
overcome and it would certainly be immeasurably superior
to the present system. With public franchises
and the Nation’s land thus inuring to the benefit of
the whole people, the possibility of building up fortunes
of two hundred and three hundred millions, or
even of eight or ten millions, would be done away
with. Surely this would be no misfortune!”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Professor, “I have heard the objection
raised to plans of this nature that their adoption
would tend to lessen competitive activity and
deaden men’s energy and ambition generally.”</p>

<p>“The objection is ill-founded,” replied the High
President. “If the maximum which a man might
hope to attain were fixed at one million, or less, men
would strive just as zealously for the fixed amount
as they would when the possibilities are unlimited.
As it is now, money makes money. It is not so much
the billionaire himself who earns as the sheer weight
of money behind him which accomplishes. He is
not called upon to exercise any particular creative
effort on his part and, worst of all, he handicaps the
efforts of others more worthy. In any event, the
guiding spirit of our New Republic will be the happiness
and welfare of the many, as against the particular
interests and privileges of the few.”</p>

<p>“You have compared the old-time Republic adversely
with the existing Monarchy,” said the Professor,
with whom this seemed to be a sore point,
“yet from the little I have learned it seems to me
that the wrongs of the masses are as great under the
monarchy as ever they were under the Republic.”</p>

<p>“To what phase do you refer in particular?” asked
the High President.</p>

<p>“To the matter of their general welfare,” replied
the Professor. “For instance, I understand that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
coal supply is to be cornered this winter and immeasurable
want and suffering inflicted broadcast.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the High President quickly,
“thank God that necessity will be obviated!”</p>

<p>“Indeed! How so?”</p>

<p>“There have been new developments recently,” replied
the High President. “Matters have perfected
themselves more rapidly than was anticipated. There
will be no necessity to wait until next winter. The
hour has come! The New Republic is at hand!”</p>

<p>“The New Republic is at hand!” repeated Mortimer,
smiling. “Why, you speak of this New Republic
of yours almost as if it were an accomplished
fact!”</p>

<p>“So nearly an accomplished fact,” replied the
High President, “that within ten days it will be
here!”</p>

<p>The words were uttered gravely and impressively.
They carried a strange conviction.</p>

<p>For a moment Mortimer sat silent, staring at the
speaker. Then he leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p>“And the King—the existing form of government!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“A thing of the past—overthrown!”</p>

<p>“This is preposterous!” cried Mortimer, a wave
of anger flushing his brow. “I see you surrounded
by certain evidences of preparation and power, otherwise
your words would seem to me but idle vaporings.
I believe that you are engaged in an armed conspiracy
against the government, but that it will be successful
I do not for an instant believe. And,” he added with
biting sarcasm, as his anger rose, “it is indeed typical
of the strength and character of your organization
when its admitted head does not dare to discourse
sedition and treason in the presence of an officer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
the King save in closest concealment and with masked
face!”</p>

<p>The High President started slightly; then proudly
raised his head:</p>

<p>“My life is of value, not so much to me, as to the
cause I serve,” he said. “In all movements of this
character certain precautions are essential. But the
hour of precaution is well-nigh past and is certainly
no longer needed with you whom we safely hold in our
keeping. I came to you thus disguised, because I
desired to speak to you simply as the head of this organization.
I deemed it best, until I had secured
your decision on a matter I shall present to you soon.
But since this mask is made the means of a taunt to
our organization, I will remove it and meet you man
to man.”</p>

<p>As the High President ceased speaking, he raised
his hands to the mask and rapidly loosened the strings.</p>

<p>Suddenly the obscuring mists rolled aside from the
Professor’s brain, and before the mask had fairly
been removed from the High President’s features, he
sprang to his feet with the cry:</p>

<p>“General Mainwarren!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>UNFOLDING THE PLAN</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Silence from all three succeeded for a few moments
the Professor’s startled exclamation. Then the High
President spoke.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, turning to Mortimer, “now that
I have removed the source of your reproach, I trust
you will give weight and credence to my words.”</p>

<p>“General,” answered Mortimer, “your great military
record, and your eminence as one of the financial
powers of the land, are known to me as they are to the
rest of the world. Your words must, therefore, have
due weight with me, but I must admit, speaking
frankly, not credence. Were almost any other to
speak so, I should regard him as either a loose-brained
visionary, or else one seeking to deceive. With you,
I realize that neither is the case, but I cannot help
considering that you are seriously mistaken.”</p>

<p>“It is precisely to show you I am right that I am
here,” replied the High President.</p>

<p>“I’m much flattered,” said Mortimer, “although
I fail to see why you should be at any pains on that
point.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that for the moment,” answered the
High President. “You will learn the reason before
our interview closes.”</p>

<p>Mortimer bowed.</p>

<p>“I will begin by explaining to you,” said the High
President, “that this movement had its origin many
years ago—in fact, it began almost immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
after the Monarchy was first inaugurated. It began
not with a united, organized body as we are to-day,
but in a number of scattered, disunited elements possessed
of widely divergent aims and objects. There
were those who were opposed to the monarchical institution
and who desired the return of the former
Republic; there were others—and these were by far
the larger and more important body—who were profoundly
dissatisfied with the existing economic conditions
and who eagerly, if vaguely, aspired to a
change of some kind. There was but one common
chord uniting these various elements; all were dissatisfied
and all were more or less revolutionary. For
a period I studied the problem of how to fuse these
various scattered elements and the problem seemed so
difficult that I was for a time in despair. It was just
at that period that by a strange turn of Fate—or by
the interposition of Divine Providence, as some may
piously believe—that I found myself in a position
of commanding financial power. From that day on
the road grew easier for me. From that day on, I
vowed to dedicate my life to raising my countrymen
to a higher plane of liberty and happiness than the
world had yet known. Washington had led them to
freedom from the bondage of political tyranny; I
would seek to free them from the far more bitter
tyranny of economic bondage. To that cause, I have
through the years devoted my fortune, my energies
and my work. To that cause I am prepared, if need
be, to lay down my life.”</p>

<p>“A noble ideal, indeed!” exclaimed the Professor
enthusiastically. “I admire and respect you for it.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate the spirit which has animated you,
General,” said Mortimer, “although I dissent from
some of the methods you may have adopted in its execution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“My first care,” said the High President, disregarding
the interruption, “was to look about me for
some means of unifying the various scattered elements
of political and economic discontent. This I soon
perceived could not be quickly done. It was a question
of time, and above all, of education. By education,
I mean teaching the individual members of the
different elements precisely what were the causes of
their unhappiness and discontent, wherein the true
remedies lay and just what were the conditions they
must seek to attain. To this end I carefully trained
a corps of instructors, men and women. These people
preached no sedition; they advocated no revolutionary
movement. They simply taught a new form
of interesting political economy, showing people why
they suffered and where lay the remedy. I had not
so much interest or concern for the great mass of those
forming the existing army of discontent. They
were mostly too set in their own old ideas and aims,
although even among these were found some good
material. My chief attention was given to the rising
generation. Youth is easily taught and the impressions
of youth are usually vivid and lasting. It
was to the youth of the land we turned and the results
exceeded the highest expectations. Before long there
were great bodies of men throughout the country—men
eager and bold with the intensity of youth—who
were filled not with the vague, shadowy ideas of
the political partisan, but with a clear knowledge of
economics. And it was to the women of the country—to
the mothers, the wives and the sisters—that
we owed this most largely—a plan which I once had
the pleasure of suggesting to you as applicable to your
day, Professor Dean.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” exclaimed the Professor, “but little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
did I think you had actually put it into practical execution.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had,” answered the High President dryly.
“While this work of education was going on I was
doing everything in my power to render the general
conditions hard as possible for the masses. It was
a curious dual rôle I filled. With my entire being
pledged to their ultimate upraising and welfare, I was
temporarily inflicting upon them terrible hardship
and suffering. By many I was regarded as a monster
in human form; even the Court and the Chancellerie
protested against what seemed to be my insatiable
exactions—protested not because of the widespread
misery and suffering inflicted, but because of the
dangerous spirit of public discontent engendered.
Ah, little they suspected that it was precisely this
dangerous spirit of discontent which I sought to foster
and to feed, for it is through the suffering and
the misery of the people that the spirit is awakened
which leads to great changes. In the light of this
explanation, Professor, you will now understand the
true meaning of the proposed corner in coal which so
aroused your horror and indignation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see it all now!” exclaimed the Professor.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, there will now be no necessity for
that measure and the awful misery and suffering it
would have entailed,” continued the High President.
“But I will pass from that painful subject. In addition
to the education of the people and to tuning the
public spirit to the proper pitch of discontent and revolt
by purposely imposed hardship and misery, I
was busy with one other important subject. Governments
and existing conditions may eventually be overthrown
by education and the sentiment of the masses,
but they cannot be thus directly overthrown. Governments
and existing conditions are backed, supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and held in power by force, which is really
the first and last word in the affairs of this world.
Education as to cause, effect and remedy and the
fostering of the necessary sentiment and spirit among
the masses were well enough by way of general introductory
processes, but if the overthrow of the monarchy
and the establishment of a new order of things
was to be looked for, some means must be found of
successfully overcoming the resistance of the armed
forces of the King and of the Government. Do you
follow me?”</p>

<p>“Very clearly,” replied Dean, while Mortimer
nodded a silent assent.</p>

<p>“As a soldier trained by practical experience in the
art of war,” continued the High President, “I realized
how utterly futile it must be to attempt to arm,
drill and organize a sufficient force of men to hope
to successfully cope in open warfare with the trained
soldiers of the King. To achieve successfully any
such result, I must discover a new means of warfare
which would give my attacking force some immeasurable
advantage over our opponents. Not an easy
problem to work out, eh, Captain Mortimer?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly not,” replied Mortimer with evident
interest.</p>

<p>“As you are perhaps aware,” resumed the High
President, “among the different great business interests
to which I came into possession were several
which involved various manufacturing processes.
Among the many employes in my shops was a wild,
apparently half-crazy sort of fellow who was, however,
exceedingly clever as an inventor and who had
already devised several really very ingenious and
meritorious inventions. The man’s first name was
Nicholas; we will suppress for the present his last
name. He was American born, but originally of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Polish origin and his forefathers had all, I understand,
been inventors. This erratic fellow came to
me one day. He had come across some old-time
pamphlets or treatises in the library upon the subject
of aërial navigation. There was one treatise by a
certain Professor Dean which seemed to attract his
interest strongly. He was full of the project and
wanted to pursue an extended line of investigation of
aërial navigation. I confess I listened with scant interest.
The field seemed to me an unprofitable one
commercially, for I could not see what practical benefit
from a transportation standpoint would be gained
by aërial navigation. It was doubtless for this very
reason, I argued to myself, that the subject had thus
far not been more fully taken up and advanced.
Nicholas, however, was evidently not easily to be discouraged
and I regarded his enthusiasm as a species
of misfortune. Here was one of my valuable men
off on a tangent and the result could only be that I
would be a loser of his best efforts. However, I did
not abruptly refuse Nicholas, but out of consideration
for his feelings promised to give the matter some further
thought.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the Professor, “how history repeats
itself! It was always my experience whenever
I approached men of position and power on that very
subject to meet with discouragement and doubt.”</p>

<p>“Listen to the sequel,” said the High President.
“That night I walked in my grounds. It was a
rarely beautiful night, with a high, clear sky and a
bright, full moon. My mind was occupied with its
still unsolved problem. I looked up to the heavens
above me, as if to seek there inspiration and light.
Suddenly the thought flashed into my mind: What
if an attack could be delivered from the skies above—from
the very heavens themselves! Such an attacking
force would be absolutely safe from attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
itself, while by dropping high explosives upon any
enemy below it could inflict untold devastation.
Then Nicholas came into my mind.”</p>

<p>“But such form of attack is expressly forbidden
by the rules of international warfare!” exclaimed
Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” answered the High President,
“but the rules of international warfare do not
apply to revolutions by a people against their government.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” admitted Mortimer grudgingly.</p>

<p>“The next morning I sent for Nicholas,” said the
High President. “He found a much changed man.
It will be needless for me to recount to you the ten
thousand and one details in connection with the perfecting
of our plans; our secret work of invention,
our secret processes of manufacture, our secret
places of trial and concealment of finished machines.
Take, for instance, where we now are. We have here
quite an extensive strip of territory, in a wild, little
frequented region. It is held as private property.
In the heart of this territory is this valley shut in on
all sides by mountain heights—and it affords us
ample opportunity of carrying on such work as may
be necessary, quite safe from observation. On every
side our men are out in the guise of keepers, carefully
guarding every avenue of approach against possible
chance of intrusion. Similar strips of territory
and similar retreats we hold in various other parts
of the country, for our plans are far too carefully laid
for us to trust all our eggs to one basket. Let it be
enough for me to say that everything has thus far progressed
most satisfactorily and that we have to-day
concealed in various places, all finished and ready for
use, a sufficient number of air-ships, large and small,
to carry out our plans. All this has been done with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
such well-managed quietude and secrecy that not the
slightest inkling has the government of the true state
of affairs. You will now understand, Professor
Dean, what I meant the day I remarked to you that
your investigations in the line of aërial navigation
were more important to the world than you dreamed
of. You will also understand why it was that I was
so desirous of inducing you to leave the Court and
come to me to pursue your further work in that direction.
It was not that I really needed you to develop
air-ships, for that had already been accomplished;
but I feared you might produce them for
the benefit of the government. Such possible production
was to us the most serious menace to our
course, as you will doubtless realize.”</p>

<p>“Yes; now that I understand all the circumstances,”
answered the Professor, “I see that very
clearly.”</p>

<p>“As it was,” said the High President, “you certainly
sprang your air-ship upon us with remarkable
rapidity. I congratulate you upon your work and ourselves
upon the fact that we have succeeded in capturing
you and your ship before you had gone further.
You can imagine the surprise to our fellows
when they hailed and discovered that they were being
pursued by a Royal air-ship. They are indeed
to be commended for the discretion and skill with
which they acted.”</p>

<p>“In what respect?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“They had a machine on board,” answered the
High President, “which would have blown you to
atoms, had they so desired, or they could have clapped
on speed and have escaped you. Had they been
fools, they would have done one or the other. Being
sensible men, they did neither. They simply regulated
their speed so as to lure you on and thus lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
to your capture. You see, it was desirable to ascertain
as much about you as possible and learn how
grave a peril to us your presence signified.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for the peculiar movements I
noticed during our pursuit,” remarked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” replied the High President. “Well,
I am truly thankful they kept their wits and acted
as they did. I am glad they did not allow you to
escape and I am even more glad they did not resort
to the other course. I abhor any unnecessary shedding
of blood and I am grateful to Providence that
our operations that night cost, at most, only one life.
I may say to you that the life of the King has been
repeatedly in our hands during our various visitations,
but not one hair of his head has been injured.”</p>

<p>“What was the object of these visitations?” asked
the Professor curiously.</p>

<p>“To satisfy fully the scruples of some of the more
conscientious among the leaders,” answered the High
President. “The present King had shown himself
to be a more just and mild-mannered ruler than
his predecessor and they thought he should be accorded
the saving chances of reform and abdication.
I was opposed to the plan as affording little
prospect of practical results, but yielded so as to
satisfy the consciences of these men—so that when
the time came to strike they could feel that we had
done so only after no other course was left.”</p>

<p>“I see—I understand,” said the Professor
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the High President, “all is prepared.
The air-ships are ready and their crews
drilled to their work. We have in addition a sufficiently
large number of men trained to act as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
auxiliary land force to follow up at the right moment
the devastating work of the air-ships. The officers
pin a gold star, the men a white star—the Star
of Hope—to their left shoulders and in an instant
you have a force sufficiently recognizable for our
purposes. Should any body of men be compelled
to retreat, they scatter, off with the star from the
shoulder, and in an instant are re-converted into ordinary
citizens. Conceive a body of men in a number
of mobiles, so built as to be protected from
ordinary rifle fire, and, hovering in the distance,
awaiting the moment, a scattered mass of men on
foot. These latter carry only concealed arms, and
are apparently noncombatants. Imagine the men in
the mobiles opening an attack upon a royal regiment,
or other hostile body. The royal troops advance
to the attack and the men in the mobiles begin
to retreat. Then, from the heavens above, the air-ships,
themselves unassailable, open their attack and
hurl down high explosives upon the advancing
troops. What becomes of the regiment? In a few
moments it is decimated—annihilated! All that
remains is for the men in the motors and the scattered
footmen in the distance to sweep down upon
the scene and take charge of the dead, the dying and
the prisoners. The same way in attacking a fort,
or royal palace. Our air-ships would hover high
above and, themselves beyond the reach of rifles, or
of cannon, pursue their attack until the work of demolition
was complete. As a military man, Captain
Mortimer, I ask you how can such an attack be
successfully resisted?”</p>

<p>“Are your air-ships rifle proof?” asked Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Perfectly so from all sides,” answered the High<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
President; “but even if they were not, it would be
an easy matter for them to keep beyond range.”</p>

<p>“Quite so; and they could, of course, still be able
to direct the explosives hurled with sufficient accuracy?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” replied the High President. “I
ask you again how can such a form of attack be resisted?”</p>

<p>Mortimer hesitated a moment before replying.</p>

<p>“It is obvious,” he said at length, “that if one
thousand riflemen are attacked in the manner you
describe by one hundred of an enemy whom they
cannot by any possibility reach or inflict any punishment
whatsoever upon, the one thousand men must
necessarily succumb to the one hundred. In the case
of artillery, the artillerymen would be no better off,
for if their enemy were lodged directly above, heavy
guns could not be raised to a sufficient pitch to bring
the enemy within range. These propositions are so
simple that, I take it, there is no disputing them.”</p>

<p>“And as to a fort?” asked the High President.</p>

<p>“Substantially the same principles must apply,”
answered Mortimer.</p>

<p>“The government’s warships,” continued the High
President, “are scattered over the various seas. But
let us assume that a number of them were concentrated
in Atlantic waters. Could a ship of the sea
do successful battle with a ship of the air, hovering
directly above her and raining death and destruction
down upon her decks? I ask you, what chance would
a ship of the sea have?”</p>

<p>“A warship,” answered Mortimer with impatience,
“could, of course, not elevate her guns so as
to bring within range anything immediately above
her.”</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed the High President triumphantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
“I am pleased to find that our minds are
in accord on at least some important points and we
can now, perhaps, come to an understanding.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fully catch your meaning,” said Mortimer.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose,” answered the High President,
“that I have held this interview with you and
disclosed our position so thoroughly simply for the
purpose of discussing political economy, or questions
of military tactics?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Mortimer. “I await the
explanation of your purpose.”</p>

<p>“It is this,” replied the High President. “I
sought first to show you the merit and justice of our
cause, and next, our certitude of success. You, Captain
Mortimer, with your military experience, and
you, Professor Dean, with your scientific attainments,
would be valuable additions to our ranks—not
so much for the first attack, for all the details of
that first attack are already mapped out and settled;
but for the subsequent work of organization and
handling great masses of men which must necessarily
follow our preliminary successes. We shall first attack
the palace and almost simultaneously the city
of New York. We shall seize upon the persons of
the King and the officers of the Government. This
preliminary success and demonstration of our power
will be accompanied by uprisings all over the East,
followed a little later by similar movements in the
West and the South. How could you lend your aid
to a nobler work than the uplifting of your countrymen
in particular and of mankind in general—how
engage in a more truly patriotic task! I invite you—I
beg you—to aid in this cause—to join our
ranks.”</p>

<p>The High President paused, with eager eyes turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
upon his auditors. For some moments they sat in
silence.</p>

<p>“I await your answer,” said the High President,
turning his gaze directly upon Mortimer.</p>

<p>For yet a moment Mortimer sat speechless. At
last he spoke.</p>

<p>“General Mainwarren,” he said, “I don’t doubt
the high impulses and sentiments which direct your
action, otherwise your words would convey to me the
grossest insult. Understanding these impulses and
sentiments as I do, I can accept your words in the
spirit in which they are intended. But, sir, remember
that I wear the uniform of an American army
officer. That uniform, so far as is known, has never
covered but one traitor and the world-wide obloquy
and contempt which in his own period and through
succeeding generations has followed the name of
Benedict Arnold, should be a sufficient example and
lesson for prospective traitors in all generations to
come. The function of an army officer is not to
delve in social economics, or meddle with political
questions. He must leave these matters to others.
His duty is to uphold the government of the country
and to forever stand ready to defend and die for,
if needs be, the interests and the honor of his country
and his flag. Such are the views I hold, General
Mainwarren, and—you have my answer.”</p>

<p>The High President, in turn, paused before making
reply.</p>

<p>“I, too,” he said at length, “understand and appreciate
the sentiments which dictate your answer.
I do not consider that these sentiments are correct
from the highest and broadest standpoint of patriotism
and human effort, but the answer, such as it is, I
must accept, much as I regret it. And you,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
added, turning to Professor Dean; “what is your
decision?”</p>

<p>The Professor answered without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“I am,” he said, “more in touch and sympathy
with your project and your aims than Captain Mortimer
is, or could be expected to be. Had you depicted
to me those projects and described to me those
aims on the day we first met, my answer might have
been different from that which it now must be. As
it is, I have embarked in this joint enterprise with
my friend, Captain Mortimer, and I should regard
myself as playing the rôle of traitor which he so
severely contemns were I now to fail him. I shall
stand shoulder to shoulder with Captain Mortimer
in this enterprise, at least, to the very end.”</p>

<p>The High President rose and extended his hand.</p>

<p>“Re-meeting!” he exclaimed. “My mission here
has failed. There is nothing more to be said.”</p>

<p>He moved toward the door. Dean called after
him.</p>

<p>“One moment,” he cried; “there is a question I
would ask. You spoke just now of blood having
been spilled the night of the chase. What did you
mean? Was there some mishap which happened to
those we were pursuing? I saw no accident.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the High President, pausing,
“no accident occurred to any of those you were following.
It was at the palace.”</p>

<p>“At the palace! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“According to the report made me,” continued the
High President, “it came about in this way. Our
men in the air-ship were preparing to approach the
window of the King’s chamber, but prior to doing
so were scouting around the immediate neighborhood
to ascertain if the coast was clear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Yes, yes,” exclaimed Dean, “we noticed that!”</p>

<p>“Next to the King’s chamber was a room with
open windows,” went on the High President, “occupied,
as they knew, by an officer on guard. Either
an air current must have affected the air-ship which
was at the moment almost motionless, or the steersman
made some slight miscalculation, for they suddenly
drifted in too close to the room. Our men
suddenly saw an officer in full uniform spring forward
and peer out. It looked as if he had caught
sight of them and was about to give an alarm. Instantly,
one of our men fired. The officer was seen
to stagger back and, without groan or cry, he fell!”</p>

<p>With a cry of rage and pain, as of some wounded
animal, Mortimer clenched his hands and began
pacing the floor, in deep agitation.</p>

<p>“But how can this be!” exclaimed Dean. “We
were close at hand and we heard no sound—no
shot!”</p>

<p>“You forget,” replied the High President indulgently,
“that most of our firearms to-day are noiseless
as well as smokeless.”</p>

<p>“My God—my God!” exclaimed Mortimer, still
pacing the floor, “that officer was Ralph—my comrade
and friend, Captain Swords. Tell me, did that
shot kill?”</p>

<p>“That is not known,” replied the High President.
“After the shot, our men hovered around, peering
into the lighted room and prepared to flee at the
slightest sign of an alarm. But no sign of such alarm
appeared. The officer’s fall upon the heavy carpet
appeared to have been unheard, for no one came to
the room and he lay there motionless. Our men then
passed on to their work at the King’s window, when
you appeared a moment later upon the scene. You
know the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“To think that he is lying wounded, perhaps dead,
and I here—a prisoner!” muttered Mortimer
fiercely.</p>

<p>“The fortunes of war,” replied the High President
coldly. “What is one life in such a struggle?
Alas! think of the many, many lives which must be
sacrificed before this contest closes. As to your imprisonment,
I am willing to give you the freedom of
this entire valley upon your parole not to leave it, or
to attempt any communication whatsoever with the
outside.”</p>

<p>“I refuse such parole,” answered Mortimer curtly.</p>

<p>“And you, Professor Dean?”</p>

<p>“I follow Captain Mortimer’s lead absolutely.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the High President,
“prisoners you must then remain. But console
yourselves with the thought that it will not be for
long. Ten days from to-day the signal to attack will
flash forth—in ten days from to-day the new era
will have dawned and your freedom will be near at
hand. Look forward to your liberation—as tens
upon tens of millions are awaiting their liberation—to
the birth of the New Republic!”</p>

<p>He sprang up the steps and called to the sentinel
without. The door was hurriedly thrown open and
an instant later he was gone.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A STRANGE MESSAGE</small></h3>
</div>

<p>The days passed. Captain Mortimer sat with
bowed head and heavy brow, resisting Valerie’s
archest smiles and brightest sallies. The fine appetite
he had displayed on the occasion of the first
breakfast had deserted him and Valerie’s choicest
dishes went back practically untouched. Was there
anything she could get for him? No; nothing.
Was there anything special he would like prepared?
No; absolutely nothing. To all her questions only
the same brief, though polite, negatives. Valerie
was in despair.</p>

<p>Alone with Dean, the one topic was escape. They
had again carefully examined the cabin. There were
two portholes on each side—too small to permit of
the egress of even a boy’s body—and the floors,
walls and ceilings were certainly too strongly constructed
to be open to successful attack by men whose
only tools were two pocket knives and a sword.
Evidently their only possible chance was by the door.</p>

<p>To the door, then, they turned their attention. It
was too strong to give way to any sudden onslaught
and any extended work upon it would certainly be
heard by the sentinel outside. Besides, the Professor
pointed out, even if they did succeed in breaking
through and getting past the sentry, they would
doubtless be quickly surrounded and overpowered
by the other men of the camp.</p>

<p>“It’s probably true,” Mortimer replied. “But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
intend to make an attempt at all hazards. It’s better
to die in the valley outside, after a good hot fight,
than to perish heart-broken, cooped up here.”</p>

<p>Then began a search for methods by which they
could get past the door and reach the sentinel outside.</p>

<p>“Why not lie in wait at the door,” suggested the
Professor, “and when the food is brought in we can
make one spirited dash?”</p>

<p>“No, that won’t do,” Mortimer said. “It is
Valerie who brings the food; we can’t treat her so.”</p>

<p>They discussed a plan whereby one of them was
to feign illness and ask for a doctor, or other medical
assistance; but it was repugnant to them both to seek
advantage in any form over one who came on an
ostensible errand of mercy.</p>

<p>They at last hit upon the much simpler expedient
of sending a message demanding to see the man in
command. Henry, with his brutal directness, would
probably jump at the conclusion that they sought
some concession, or had some terms to propose. With
him they would have no scruples.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when Valerie brought in the dinner
on the fourth day following the visit of the High
President, the Professor broached the subject.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Robert—” he began.</p>

<p>“Call me Valerie. Everybody does here. It’s
so much simpler,” said the girl, as she busied herself
with the table.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; certainly. My dear Miss Valerie—”</p>

<p>“Simply Valerie; or you may say ‘dear Valerie,’
if you like,” replied the girl, archly.</p>

<p>“Well—ah—Valerie, then!” stammered the
Professor, “would you mind conveying a message
for us, or, to speak more accurately, I should say causing
a message to be conveyed for us, since we would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
prefer—and you will no doubt know how to manage
this—that such message should not come from either
yourself or your father. Perhaps, I might suggest,
you could so contrive as to enable us to send it by
one of the sentinels outside this door?”</p>

<p>The girl glanced at the Professor curiously.</p>

<p>“What is the message?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That we demand to see the person in command
here—Colonel Henry, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Oh! won’t father do?”</p>

<p>“No, no; not at all! We want to see the one in
chief command.”</p>

<p>“Any complaint as to the cooking or the service?”
asked the girl pertly.</p>

<p>“Really, Miss——”</p>

<p>“Valerie!”</p>

<p>“You embarrass me.”</p>

<p>“I love to do that!”</p>

<p>“But you will grant what we ask?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see about it and let you know to-morrow,”
she replied, as she started for the door.</p>

<p>The following morning at breakfast they again
questioned her. She had not yet had an opportunity
to attend to the matter. At mid-day the same answer,
but a promise that they should have word at
the next meal.</p>

<p>The next meal came and with it Valerie. The captives
felt their hearts sink at her first words. Colonel
Henry would not see them.</p>

<p>“What was it he said when our message was given
him?” asked Mortimer, “and by whom was it
given?”</p>

<p>Valerie hesitated in a manner very unusual to her
before replying. Then she broke out impetuously:</p>

<p>“He did not say anything, because the message
wasn’t carried. It would have been useless. Papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
tells me that the High President gave imperative
orders that Colonel Henry was not to deal in any
way with you. You are held subject to the orders
of the High President himself.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you send the message anyhow?”
demanded Mortimer, a bit impatiently. “Colonel
Henry might decide to see us—you can’t tell. You
don’t realize how important it is that we see him.”</p>

<p>She did not answer these reproaches for some moments.
Then suddenly she turned upon Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Even if the High President hadn’t given such
orders, do you think I would bring you and ‘Black
Hawk’ Henry face to face after what has happened?
Colonel Henry is furious. You throttled
him before his men and on top of that he was severely
reprimanded by the High President for his treatment
of prisoners.”</p>

<p>“How about the insult to me—the cause of it
all?” Mortimer asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” she answered,
“but I’m not so foolish as to bring burning oil and
gunpowder together! Won’t father do as well?”
she asked in conclusion.</p>

<p>“No!” Mortimer hastened to answer.</p>

<p>“Will anybody else?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; anybody else will do, if he doesn’t come
direct from Captain Robert,” Mortimer assured her.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how it can be managed,” she said.</p>

<p>For a moment they were both in despair. Then
Mortimer spoke up.</p>

<p>“You’ve been very kind to us,” he began, “and
we’re indebted to you for many favors. Believe me,
we both of us appreciate and are grateful to you from
the bottom of our hearts.”</p>

<p>A deepening tinge of color crept into the girl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
face, as she looked up at him with smiling eyes, her
white teeth showing between her full, red lips.</p>

<p>“We have one more favor to ask of you,” he continued,
“a rather peculiar favor and one which, I
trust, you won’t misunderstand. Should you decide
to grant it, you must do so blindly, without asking a
single question as to the why or wherefore.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the girl eagerly.</p>

<p>“Just this: that to-morrow one of our meals shall
not be brought by you and that you will let us know
in advance which of those meals it is to be.”</p>

<p>The girl’s head dropped and the color paled from
her face. For a moment she said nothing. Then
she looked up.</p>

<p>“The dinner is ready,” she said. “Why don’t
you eat?”</p>

<p>“I can’t eat to-night,” answered Mortimer impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s horrible to see you pining away in this
fashion,” said the girl. “You’ll die if this keeps
up.”</p>

<p>“Men don’t die so easily,” replied Mortimer, with
a short laugh. “But you haven’t answered what I
asked you.”</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“Do nothing—make no attempt of any kind to-day,”
she cried with sudden vehemence. “Wait until
to-morrow! To-morrow I’ll bring you good
news!”</p>

<p>And with these words she turned quickly and fled
up the steps.</p>

<p>At breakfast time next morning she lingered in
the cabin longer than usual. To Mortimer’s questioning
glance, she returned for answer the single
word: “Wait!”</p>

<p>At mid-day she appeared, bearing her tray as usual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
but when she began to unload it they noticed skilfully
concealed among the dishes, two small coils of
rope. Her cheeks were flushed and here was an
unwonted agitation in her manner.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t eat my food,” she said, “so I’ve
brought you something which will be more welcome.”
And she touched one of the coils of rope lightly with
her finger.</p>

<p>“Won’t you speak more plainly?” exclaimed the
Professor, with evident excitement.</p>

<p>“My meaning!” retorted the girl, with impatience.
“What do you suppose I mean except—your
escape. Do you think I am both blind and stupid!
Do you think I haven’t seen how you,” and she
glanced toward Mortimer, “have been eating your
hearts out here? Do you imagine I didn’t guess
your meaning when you wanted the ‘Black Hawk’
to come to you, or when you wanted me to keep
away? Valerie was bright enough to understand the
meaning of that!”</p>

<p>“We certainly didn’t mean to reflect upon your
intelligence,” replied the Professor. “We only
hoped you would close your eyes sufficiently to aid us
in our plans.”</p>

<p>“There’s a big move of some kind about to take
place here,” said Valerie, “and it wouldn’t astonish
me if father were ordered away at any moment.
Now, I’m not going to take any chance of leaving
you here at the mercy of the ‘Black Hawk.’ He’d
kill you at the first chance—he’s quite capable of it.
So I’ll help you in any way to get off.”</p>

<p>“We thank you heartily,” answered the Professor.
“But what’s your plan?”</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Valerie. “All the men in camp
here have gone off to Minden Plains, which are back
of Pedisgill Hill, to practise some special manœuver—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
except the man at the door here, and five men
who are at work in Big Bear Gap, which is almost at
the other end of the valley. They are at work on
some air-ships there and the ‘Black Hawk’ is keeping
an eye over them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” assented the Professor, “but how
are we going to get out of here?”</p>

<p>“When I next return,” said Valerie, “you will
seize and bind me securely with one of these cords,
which for all anybody will know you found by ransacking
the cabin.”</p>

<p>“But how shall we deal with the sentry outside?”
questioned the Professor.</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be simple enough,” replied Valerie.
“Jack is on guard and Jack will do anything I say,
even though it were to send a bullet through the
‘Black Hawk’ himself. After you have secured
me, you will give three light taps upon the door.
Jack won’t be very much surprised when he opens the
door if you suddenly pounce upon him and secure
him in the same way that you do me. You are two to
one and his capture need not create suspicion. He
will struggle, of course, just to keep up appearances,
but don’t hurt the poor boy, since he is really our
friend.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the plan,” broke in Mortimer, speaking
for the first time, “since it involves violence—or
rather the appearance of violence—to you. I
would much rather you were not mixed up in this—much
rather that it were managed by that fellow
Henry coming here, or someone else.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly!” exclaimed Valerie. “It’s the
kindest thing you can do for me, since it will serve
to divert suspicion far more than any other plan.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t like it,” retorted Mortimer obstinately.
“I would give almost anything I possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
to escape from here, but I don’t like your being involved.”</p>

<p>“I’m bound,” said Valerie, determinedly, “that
you shall not remain behind at the mercy of the
‘Black Hawk.’ You’ve got to escape. But,” she
added, her manner softening, “you’ll promise me
that after you are safely away, you will never bring
anything here that will do injury to me or mine—to
the men of this camp?”</p>

<p>“Should I ever succeed in escaping,” answered
Mortimer solemnly, “I’ll promise never to disclose
the situation of this valley, or to lead, or direct, any
attacking force here. More than this I can’t promise.”</p>

<p>“It is enough,” said Valerie. “And you?” she
asked, turning to Dean.</p>

<p>“I hold myself bound by the same promise as that
given by Captain Mortimer,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Very well. Now listen carefully,” she continued.
“Your air-ship has been moved from where
you last saw it. It’s no longer in this inlet. When
you pass the door, keep straight out into the main
valley. The moment you reach the valley you will
notice, a short distance away, two inlets to the right.
Keep on to the second inlet and there, among several
others, you will find your air-ship. If you are seen
at all, it won’t be until after you have risen well
over the mountain tops, and long before any of the
men can get back to the air-ships, you will be well
out of sight and beyond any chance of pursuit. Besides,
I don’t believe they will attempt any chase as
they have never taken any chance of the air-ships
being seen by going above the mountain tops in daylight.
How the ‘Black Hawk’ will carry on when
he finds you have got away! I owe him a grudge
or two and it will be great fun to see him storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
and rage. You have now the whole plan. Are you
sure you understand it?”</p>

<p>“Quite!” replied the Professor.</p>

<p>“Keep it well in mind, then,” said Valerie. “In
half an hour I shall be back and the time for you will
have come.”</p>

<p>She ran up the steps and tapped three times lightly
on the door. As it opened they caught a glimpse
of the big, good-natured face of the sentry, as he
beamed joyously upon the departing Valerie.</p>

<p>When the door closed after her, Mortimer began
striding up and down the cabin, strongly agitated by
conflicting emotions. On the one hand was his strong
desire to escape from confinement, so maddening under
existing circumstances; on the other hand was
his dislike for the means to be adopted.</p>

<p>“Is it right?” he asked the Professor, “to let
this girl mix herself up in this? We ought not to let
her run risks in our behalf. How do we know what
may be the consequences to her? If she’s suspected,
this devil, Henry, would stop at nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re hypersensitive,” responded the Professor.
“Valerie can be trusted to find her way
out of any entanglement. The best thing for us is
to accept the chance she offers and get away.”</p>

<p>Mortimer listened, but shook his head moodily and
seemed by no means satisfied.</p>

<p>Thus the half-hour quickly sped by and, punctually
at its expiration, the door opened and Valerie reappeared.</p>

<p>“All ready?” she exclaimed, in rapid tones.</p>

<p>Mortimer raised his head slowly.</p>

<p>“I shall not go,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not go! and why?”</p>

<p>“For the reasons I’ve explained. Don’t think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
though, that I am insensible to your great kindness—that
I thank you the less.”</p>

<p>“Keep your thanks till some other time,” exclaimed
Valerie, with flushed cheeks; “now is the
time to act. You won’t go, eh? We’ll see about
that. When I make up my mind to something, that
something generally comes off, as you shall see!”</p>

<p>With these words she sprang up the steps and tapped
on the door. It was immediately opened.</p>

<p>“Jack, come here!”</p>

<p>Jack, grinning broadly, promptly descended into
the cabin. Valerie dropped into a seat and pointed
to one of the little coils of rope.</p>

<p>“Tie me, Jack.”</p>

<p>Jack’s eyes opened wide in astonishment and he
hesitated.</p>

<p>“Tie me, Jack. Since when did you begin to disobey
my orders? Hurry, I say.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Jack seized the rope and, with
a few skilful turns, bound her fast.</p>

<p>“Now,” she cried triumphantly, turning her head
toward Mortimer, “now will you go, or will you remain
here until someone comes and finds us and we
all get into trouble for nothing?”</p>

<p>“Yes; hurry up and do something,” cried Jack
impatiently. “Either I must be choked dumb and
tied up, or I must get back to my post. What are
you making so much fuss about anyway? Don’t
you want to go back home to fight? You look like a
pretty niftily set up sort of a man,” he continued,
addressing Mortimer, “but the other doesn’t look as
if he would count for much. Come, hurry up!
You’ve wasted too much time already!”</p>

<p>“You’re right!” exclaimed the Professor, and,
rope in hand, he fell upon Jack and quickly secured
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>As for Mortimer, Jack’s reference to going home to
fight aroused him. Rapidly there flashed through
his mind the vision of a strangely-fought and bloody
struggle in progress, his regiment attacked and he
absent from his men and from his duty.</p>

<p>He glanced at the Professor now rapidly completing
the work of securing Jack. Then he crossed to
where Valerie sat.</p>

<p>“You win,” he said with emotion; “I accept your
sacrifice and will go. But remember, should you
find yourself in peril as the result of this, one word
sent to me at the palace and I’m at all times ready
to return and surrender myself.”</p>

<p>“Include me in that proposition,” interjected
Dean.</p>

<p>“Pull tighter round the ankles!” called out Jack,
and the Professor again bent to his task. A couple
more turns of the rope, a few sharp tugs and he stood
up, his work completed.</p>

<p>“Go!” whispered Valerie, with pleading lips and
eyes upturned to Mortimer. “Go, before it is too
late.”</p>

<p>He lingered yet a moment.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget my offer,” he said, “should you
find yourself in peril. I hold myself your debtor for
life. You will remember?”</p>

<p>“Ah! But will you remember something?” returned
Valerie hastily. “You are going into a
greater danger than will surround me. In these
awful days that are to come it is you that most likely
will need help. Will you remember you have a
friend among your—enemies? If I can help you,
remember I—I—Oh! Go, go quickly!”</p>

<p>“Come, it’s time we were off,” exclaimed the Professor,
touching Mortimer lightly upon the arm.
The Captain started. Stooping, he kissed Valerie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
hand and tried to murmur his gratitude to the girl,
before he turned to follow the Professor. Tears
were in her eyes; her lips trembled slightly.</p>

<p>They reached the head of the steps and were outside
the door. Mortimer turned and waved a farewell.
Then Dean banged to the door and shot the
bolts.</p>

<p>Rapidly they traversed the gully, reached the main
valley and peered out. No one was in sight. To the
right were the two gullies, just as Valerie had described.
Skirting closely the base of the mountain
to keep as much as possible out of sight, they reached
the entrance to the first gully and peered in.</p>

<p>They saw several air-ships, but nothing else. On
they kept and, a few moments later, had reached the
second gully. Air-ships here, too, and, joyful sight,
their own air-ship away back at the end there. The
coast was evidently clear and they would reach it in
a few minutes and be on board. How fresh and
sweet the air smelled! How good it was to be free!</p>

<p>They pushed on over the intervening space and
had proceeded some fifty yards when around the
stern of one of the air-ships before them a man came
into sight. One glance at the burly figure and black
beard was sufficient. It was the “Black Hawk.”</p>

<p>They recognized him and, with an astonished
shout, he as quickly recognized them.</p>

<p>Instantly he advanced toward them.</p>

<p>They were in a species of small clearing, with air-ships
on all four sides. Mortimer halted. All his
moodiness had disappeared. There was a strange
light in his eyes and a smile upon his lips. He cast
a rapid glance around him. There were no others
in sight. Ah, God was good! There was the blue
sky above their heads and the green grass beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
their feet and he and the “Black Hawk” were face
to face.</p>

<p>An instant more and he confronted them. A
sword hung at his side and upon his left shoulder
there glittered the gold star of an officer of the Army
of the New Republic.</p>

<p>“So,” he said, his black beard bristling, his eyes
snapping with hatred, “so you dogs have escaped
from your kennel, eh?”</p>

<p>From Mortimer there came no reply. He stood
gazing upon his enemy, the same peculiar light in his
eyes and smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>“But you’ll quickly march back again,” he continued,
with a malignant snarl. “At least one of
you. As for you, Mr. Fine Feathers, I am glad to
see you are armed, for no blame can then be put upon
me. Later, too, I’ll find out how all this happened.
I suspect that heifer, Valerie, had a hand in this!”</p>

<p>The words sealed his fate. For Valerie’s sake,
the thought flashed through Mortimer’s mind, this
man must not escape him.</p>

<p>“Let me first pay my debt!” he exclaimed, and
his long, sinuous arm shot out and struck Henry,
with open palm, full in the face.</p>

<p>The blow was so sharp and so sudden that Henry
reeled. In an instant, however, he had recovered
himself and his hand flew to his sword. Mortimer
drew with equal celerity.</p>

<p>They sprang together and their swords crossed.</p>

<p>Henry was an expert swordsman and was regarded
among the men of the camp as an invincible champion
with this weapon. He attacked with all the confidence
of one who holds victory certain. He little
dreamed, however, of the skill against which he was
now matched—a skill which in bygone days had
held wild Kurd horsemen and fiery Cossacks alike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
successfully at bay and had given its owner the reputation
of the crack swordsman of the American ranks.
Mortimer fenced smartly, as one on parade, and the
smile still hovered about his lips as he parried his
opponent’s fierce attacks.</p>

<p>It was soon over. There was a quick parry, a
sharp feint and Mortimer’s arm shot out in a lightning-like
lunge. Back reeled Henry and dropped
heavily to earth. Mortimer’s sword had passed beneath
his opponent’s black beard and had penetrated
deep into the throat. He lay gasping—dying;
choked with the blood which ebbed from the great
wound and gushed in a gory tide over his neck and
breast.</p>

<p>Mortimer shook the blood from his sword.</p>

<p>“That’s what the swordsmen of the French school
call ‘<i>le coup de cochon</i>,’” he said. “It’s a very
neat stroke—when properly delivered.” And he
turned coolly toward Dean.</p>

<p>But the latter stood leaning for support against the
side of one of the air-ships, looking with strained
eyes and blanched face at the form upon the ground.</p>

<p>“Ah, I forgot,” exclaimed Mortimer, “you’re not
accustomed to scenes of this kind. It’s astonishing,
though, how soon one does get used to them in war.”</p>

<p>“Can we lend him no aid,” asked Dean and, overcoming
his feelings, he advanced and knelt beside the
wounded man.</p>

<p>“He’s beyond human assistance, I assure you,”
said Mortimer. “I have never known a recovery
from that stroke.”</p>

<p>And he was right, for as Dean bent down he saw a
great shiver pass over the frame of the prostrate man
and a moment later all was over; the “Black Hawk”
lay dead.</p>

<p>“Come; there is no time to lose!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
Mortimer, and seizing Dean under the arm he half
led, half carried him to where their air-ship lay. A
hasty scramble on board; an equally hasty inspection
of the apparatus to ascertain that all was in order; a
quick working of the levers by the Professor and
they were away.</p>

<p>Steadily and gracefully they rose until they were
above the mountain tops and the country lay well
beneath them. Away in the distance they perceived
a number of men, apparently engaged in the execution
of certain manœuvers. These were evidently the
men referred to by Valerie as drilling on Minden
Plain. From a sudden commotion among the men it
was evident the air-ship had been seen.</p>

<p>“We seem to be creating some excitement!” exclaimed
Mortimer, referring to this circumstance.
“I wonder if they will attempt a pursuit.”</p>

<p>“It will be a very useless effort if they do,” replied
Dean.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Mortimer, “you know their
craft is a good deal faster than ours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” answered Dean, “but long before
they can even reach their ships, we will have disappeared
from view. We are at least fast enough for
that and don’t forget that we leave no trail behind
us.”</p>

<p>Up and up they rose until they were invisible to
anything upon the surface of the earth. Onward
they sped, and no pursuing form appearing behind
them, they realized that they had indeed escaped.
For an hour or more they held on thus and at last
Dean spoke.</p>

<p>“I have been keeping entirely away from our
proper course,” he said, “as in that manner I thought
we should be less likely to be in the line of pursuit,
if indeed a pursuit be attempted at all. I feel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
we are quite safe from that now and I had best lay
the course for the palace, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I should think that would be the right thing to
do,” assented Mortimer.</p>

<p>“But first,” said Dean, “in case of any possible
further mishap, I think it would be well for us to
open up communication with Kearns and send him a
message. Don’t you think it is time that he had
one?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly,” answered Mortimer. “An excellent
idea. But can you do it? Remember the instrument
is in his room in the Chancellerie and the
windows of that room face South, while we are now
due North.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” answered Dean, “but the instrument
in that room is connected with one on the roof of the
Palace, so that at this altitude I can operate from all
four points of the compass.”</p>

<p>Dean brought the air-ship to a standstill and allowed
it to drift in the air currents. Then he applied
himself to the aërestograph.</p>

<p>Silently Mortimer sat awaiting results. Presently
Dean laid aside the instrument and turned to
Mortimer.</p>

<p>“He does not make any response,” he said. “He
is probably away from the instrument. We must try
again later.”</p>

<p>Dean again started the air-ship and for half an
hour they kept on their course. Then Dean again
stopped and gave the aërestograph a further trial.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed immediately, a pleased expression
coming into his face; “now we have him!”</p>

<p>Dean operated the instrument for a minute or more
and then was occupied for quite some time in the reception
of the reply. Kearns, thought Mortimer,
was evidently either not a very rapid or very accurate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
operator, or else the reply must be of some length.
At last it was over and Dean sent back a brief
answer.</p>

<p>“Very curious!” he muttered, laying aside the
instrument.</p>

<p>“What is very curious?” questioned Mortimer.</p>

<p>“The reply to our message.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“First let me give you what I sent,” said Dean.
“It was this: ‘We have been prisoners, but have
escaped. We are returning with big news and fullest
information.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” replied Mortimer; “that would seem
to cover the ground very nicely. And the answer?”</p>

<p>“This,” replied the Professor, “is the somewhat
curious answer I’ve received: ‘Strange happenings
since you left. Do not return direct to palace, but
time arrival until after dark and manage unseen descent
at some quiet spot. Will meet you in park at
northern end Queen’s Walk at midnight.’”</p>

<p>“That’s certainly a rather strange message,” said
Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I should call it very strange!” replied Dean
thoughtfully. And, with his hand upon the lever,
he again started on through space.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE NEW CHANCELLOR</small></h3>
</div>

<p>These were days of great news happenings at the
palace. An officer of the Guard, Captain Stanley
Mortimer, had strangely disappeared and another
officer of the Guard, Captain Ralph Swords, had been
discovered, in the anteroom of the King’s chamber,
senseless and bleeding from a mysterious bullet
wound in the head, inflicted upon him while on
guard duty. Fortunately the bullet had struck at
a sharp angle and had glanced from the parietal bone,
inflicting a severe but not necessarily fatal wound.
It had been a narrow escape for Captain Swords, who
would be laid up for some time under the palace
physician’s care.</p>

<p>There were various vague rumors afloat concerning
these events; rumors that hinted at an attempt upon
the life of the King. Still, nothing definite was
ascertainable.</p>

<p>Even more talked of was the death of Duke Marquanna,
the great Lord Chancellor of the realm, the
famous Warwick of the American monarchy. He
had been found dead in his bed on the morning following
the last Court ball, having passed away peacefully
during the night.</p>

<p>The air was full of gossip about the late Duke and
particularly as to his probable successor. It was
well known that it had been the ambition of the late
Duke that his son should succeed him. But the
Marquis Marquanna, while shining as a social leader,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
a sportsman and a setter of the fashions, seemed to
have either little ambition, or little inclination, for
the more weighty and burdensome affairs of State.
It was true he had given a name to a new cocktail, or
rather, an old cocktail somewhat altered as to its
component parts had been named after him, as also a
new style of cravat and a new brand of cigars, and the
Marquis seemed to think that with this he had accomplished
all that ought reasonably to be expected of
him in this life.</p>

<p>It thus created no very general astonishment when
the King named as his Chancellor, to succeed the late
Duke, Lord Cyril Ashley, whose fulfillment of the
duties of Vice-Chancellor had familiarized him with
the work in hand. Lord Ashley had in consequence
of this appointment severed his connection with the
Army and had at once assumed the office of Chancellor.</p>

<p>Almost his first move as Chancellor caused irritation
to those forming part of the Royal Household.
Owing to Lord Ashley’s own resignation from the
Guards and to the absence of Captain Stanley Mortimer
and the present disability of Captain Ralph
Swords, there existed one permanent and two temporary
vacancies in the Guards corps.</p>

<p>The ordinary staff appointment lay usually with
the War Office, but in the case of appointments to
the Guards the selection was made by His Majesty
himself from a list of officers specially distinguished
and submitted by the Minister of War.</p>

<p>It had leaked out—in that mysterious way that
things will leak out at Court—that Lord Ashley,
in his position of confidential adviser to the King,
had interfered in this instance with the list submitted,
as far as two of the appointments, at least, were
concerned. The officer selected to fill the permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
vacancy was Captain Farquharson, an officer of excellent
family with a gallant service record. His
name had been on the list submitted by the Minister
of War and his appointment gave general satisfaction
at Court. The other two appointments, to fill
the temporary vacancies, were those of Captain Haslam
and Captain Bagley. These two names were not
in the list furnished by the Minister of War and
neither officer had won any special distinction in the
service. Both had served in the field, and that which
was chiefly known concerning Captain Bagley was
that he had at one time been tried by court martial
for the summary execution of certain Cossacks under
circumstances—if the charges advanced were
true—of exceptional brutality. True, the charges
had not been fully proven and he had been acquitted,
but a lingering suspicion hovered over his name.
Neither of these men was of the character usually
appointed to the Guards.</p>

<p>The Court grumbled, but Lord Ashley was not the
manner of man to be perturbed over mere grumblings
and the Court was forced to console itself with the
reflection that the two unpopular appointments were,
after all, only likely to prove temporary ones.</p>

<p>In addition to this there were other and more momentous
matters attracting the attention of the Court
gossips. There were rumors—vague, undefined but
persistent—of trouble brewing in the country at
large. The Reactionists, it was asserted, were showing
unusual activity of late; several quite prominent
men, it was said, were under suspicion of secretly
fomenting insurrectionary movements and certain
startling discoveries in this connection had lately
been made, thanks to the energy of Lord Ashley, assisted
by the mysterious Mr. Kearns, who seemed to
be in such close touch with the King. In fact, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Kearns had come to be regarded as one possessed of
secret power and high influence and was the recipient
of numerous distinguished attentions forthwith.
Various persons attached to the Court sought him out,
entered into conversation and angled energetically for
information. Lady Brooke, in particular, diligently
pumped him for a long half-hour as to what he knew
regarding the mysterious disappearance of Captain
Stanley Mortimer. Mr. Kearns listened placidly;
uttered solemn generalities and told nothing. With
Lady Brooke he did go so far as to inform her that he
would furnish her with the information she desired
“in due course,” with which answer, in spite of further
energetic probings, my Lady Brooke had to rest
content. The result was that Mr. Kearns was put
down as a man who knew more than he would tell
and as a very wise person generally. He was by
no means the first with whom a well-assumed air of
reticence and oracular solemnity have passed for deep
wisdom.</p>

<p>It was further whispered that Lord Ashley and
Mr. Kearns were working hand in hand in the matter
of the suspected conspiracies and that startling disclosures
were before long to be anticipated.</p>

<p>Like most rumors, the ones in question possessed a
certain percentage of truth and fact mixed with a far
larger percentage of fiction.</p>

<p>It was indeed true that Kearns had been taken in
high favor by the King. Whether it was Mr.
Kearns’s particular aptitude for impressing people,
or whether it was due to some peculiar intuition, the
fact remained that His Majesty entertained the belief
that he was the one man above all others suited to
occupy the position of his confidential Secret Service
Chief and that it was he who was destined to unravel
the various mysteries with which His Majesty had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
in the past been annoyed. There was this much to
be said in favor of Kearns—he was free from any
political affiliations and could not by any possibility
be mixed up with any Court, or outside, influences:
an extremely desirable man, therefore, from this
viewpoint alone.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Kearns, he maintained much the same
demeanor and policy with the King that he had
adopted when under the interrogatory fire of individual
members of the Court. As a result of the last
visitation, the King had found in his chamber another
threatening document, which set forth that this
was the final warning; that only a few days’ grace
was accorded for his compliance with previous demands
and that, failing this, the impending doom
would descend.</p>

<p>The King wanted to know many particulars: the
disappearance of Captain Mortimer; the wounding
of Captain Swords.</p>

<p>Kearns adhered staunchly and steadfastly to his
invariable rule never to make partial disclosures;
never to say anything until his case was complete.
There was really much to commend itself in this plan.
Every additional person to whom information was
imparted, he considered, created an additional chance
of a leak; again, if by any chance one was on the
wrong track one could retrace one’s steps without letting
anyone know of the error into which one had
fallen and thus lessening confidence generally and the
illusion as to one’s infallibility. But the feature
which, perhaps, weighed most of all with Mr. Kearns
was that a case told bit by bit, lost much of the dramatic
sensationalism accompanying the disclosure of
the completed investigation. And Mr. Kearns loved
sensationalism and dramatic effect. He was an artist
who sought to flash up the lights suddenly upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
<i>mise en scène</i>, and the groupings after discovery, the
false scents followed up, the wrong suspicions, the
mistakes and all the precise methods employed finally
to reach the truth were so much paraphernalia of
the completed production which he desired to keep
out of sight.</p>

<p>Following his system he had told the King practically
nothing, except that “satisfactory progress”
was being made and that he would be prepared to
submit a completed case “in due course.” The
wounding of Captain Swords and the disappearance
of Captain Mortimer were incidents concerning which
he would prefer not to furnish information at the
present stage. All would be duly disclosed when
the case was completed. At this the King had
frowned, but Mr. Kearns was firm. The understanding
when he had taken up the matter was that he
should be permitted to employ his own methods—methods
which had been tested and had proved successful
in the past—and unless he were permitted to
follow out these methods, he would not be answerable
for results and would prefer to be relieved from further
prosecution of the inquiry. As the King was
intensely eager for the successful prosecution of the
inquiry, and as Kearns was a man who spoke with
confidence in his ultimate success, the King arrived
at the conclusion that it was best to permit him to
pursue matters in his own peculiar way. Should his
predictions ultimately turn out a mere fiasco, the
royal favor could be withdrawn and Kearns driven
forth in disgrace.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley, too, had approached Kearns, intimating
diplomatically that they work together. Faced
with this situation, Kearns rapidly cast matters over
in his mind and decided to adhere to his customary
policy. He could see nothing to be gained by filtering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
out such information as he possessed to Lord
Ashley; on the other side, there might be distinct
disadvantages in disclosing his hand and showing
how little he so far really held there. Lord Ashley
had, therefore, failed to secure anything from
Kearns, which circumstance he seemed to accept with
rather bad grace.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Kearns was sorely puzzled.
Summing up all he really knew, it amounted to but
little. He knew how the visitations by the enemies
of the King were contrived, but as to who these enemies
were, where they lurked and what their resources
and objects were, he was still in the dark.
He shrewdly surmised the facts of the attempt upon
the life of Captain Swords; still that was a mere collateral
incident and did not avail him to any appreciable
extent. Lastly, he knew the details accompanying
the disappearance of Captain Mortimer, but
with the possession of these details his knowledge in
that direction reached its limit.</p>

<p>What had become of Captain Mortimer and Professor
Dean? Kearns felt he had made a very close
guess as to the actual truth. That they had met
with some disaster to their air-ship and been hurled
to destruction was, of course, possible; but Kearns
did not accept this theory. He had the utmost confidence
in the Professor. He was a cautious man;
knew well what he was about; had made careful tests
of his air-ship, and had said it could fly. This was
enough to convince Kearns. Besides, if an accident
had happened, news of it from some source would
have been had. In this way Kearns deduced the
truth, though for him it was only a theory that in following
up the pursuit they had either been led into
some trap or else overpowered by those whom they
followed and made prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Kearns had not been blind to this latter possibility
from the beginning. The danger of it had occupied
his attention long before the Professor and Mortimer
had started, but it was a danger he saw no way
of averting under the circumstances. There was
nothing to be done but to run the risk.</p>

<p>And now this very possibility which he had foreseen,
but could not provide against, appeared to have
come to pass! What was to be done?</p>

<p>He had an ingenious but elaborate scheme of his
own by which the missing ones might possibly be
traced, but he laid it aside as one involving the
expenditure of too much time and affording too many
chances of failure. He preferred to wait quietly in
the expectant hope that matters would presently take
a turn his way. Captain Mortimer, he argued, was
a man of energy, determination and courage; the
Professor was full of scientific resources. He had
faith in these qualities of his two associates; he had
an abiding faith, too, in his own good luck, which had
rarely deserted him at a critical point. Whether it
was a species of intuition or whether it was simply
confidence bred from past successes he knew not, but
something within him seemed to say that the right
policy was to watch quietly and wait and things
would yet come his way.</p>

<p>But how long that might take and how long the
King’s patience would hold out, were knotty questions
which sorely perplexed Mr. Kearns.</p>

<p>He was aware from certain news which reached
him and certain observations that, since his refusal
to indulge in disclosures, Lord Ashley was doing active
work in various directions, employing for this
purpose the men of the regular Secret Service.
Kearns had had certain men of the Secret Service
assigned to him by the King, in case he should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
use for their services. These men regarded him as
their possible future chief and were anxious enough
to serve him. They brought him reports, therefore,
of the efforts of Lord Ashley which were then being
made through their fellows. They also brought him
news concerning the restlessness and discontent prevalent
throughout the country, which appeared to
have been largely fomented by the grasping operations
of various great Trusts, inflicting such hardships on
the people as to make them desperate. A peculiar
and suspicious circumstance, too, was the organizing,
arming and drilling of many new military bodies,
formed ostensibly as auxiliary volunteer regiments.
There seemed to be a peculiar free-masonry about
them which rendered it practically impossible for
any stranger to enroll among them and so discover
something more definite as to their true internal
affairs. All this, Kearns was aware, was known to
Lord Ashley, who in addition had further information
which had not yet reached him.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, no great surprise to him when
on the morning of the sixth day after the departure
of the Dean air-ship, the King sent for him and
opened the interview by announcing that Lord Ashley
had succeeded in making important discoveries.
Kearns, with an air of well-assumed indifference, inquired
if he might venture to ask what these discoveries
might be. His Majesty was pleased to smile
indulgently and reply that Lord Ashley seemed to be
rivaling Kearns in the matter of reticence. Certain
facts, however, His Majesty was willing to impart to
Kearns. They might, he suggested, assist his investigations
and, if their views were agreed, he might see
his way to co-operating with Lord Ashley.</p>

<p>His Majesty then gave the information that Lord
Ashley had made discoveries convincing him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
certain conspiracies were hatching and certain seditious
movements on foot. Lord Ashley had information
showing Captain Stanley Mortimer’s participation
in these treasonable transactions. He had, in
fact, aided and abetted the enemies of the King upon
the occasion of their last visitation to the palace and,
believing he had been seen and recognized by Captain
Swords, had shot the latter and escaped, never
to return, or else, learning that no suspicion had
attached itself to him on account of the Swords incident,
he would return and tender some specious pretext
for his absence. Of course, his presence in the
palace would be a danger and a menace.</p>

<p>Kearns listened to the end. Only the august presence
in which he stood prevented him from laughing
outright.</p>

<p>“And are these the disclosures Lord Ashley made
to you, Sire?” asked Kearns, with a cynical smile.</p>

<p>“Such is, in brief, part of the report,” said the
King. “What have you to say to it?”</p>

<p>“Simply this, Sire,” answered Kearns; “it shows
how grievously a man will blunder when he dabbles
in an art he doesn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you differ with Lord Ashley?”</p>

<p>“Not only differ with him, Sire,” replied Kearns
boldly, “but I pronounce him wholly and utterly
wrong. Why, Captain Swords himself can assure
you of this!”</p>

<p>“Captain Swords,” said the King, “did not see
his assailant and is himself, I am informed, entirely
deceived as to Captain Mortimer.”</p>

<p>“I beg to assure you, Sire,” declared Kearns
earnestly, “that Captain Mortimer has been guilty
of no conspiracy, or other seditious act. He is one
of the bravest and most loyal officers in Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
Majesty’s service. You have been utterly misled in
this matter.”</p>

<p>“You speak with such conviction,” said the King,
“that your words carry weight with us. Still, we
would learn the reasons with which you support your
assertions.”</p>

<p>“When I assumed this task, Sire,” replied Kearns,
“it was with the express stipulation that I should
be permitted to adopt my own methods. I must beg
you, Sire, to permit me to withhold my report until
I can present a completed case.”</p>

<p>“Be it as you ask, then,” said the King, with a
slight frown. “We would not have it in your power
to ascribe failure to any interference you had met
with. In the meantime, you must not be astonished
if we give ear and weight to the disclosures of Lord
Ashley. He, at least, brings some news and that
news we regard as of sufficient importance to warrant
the apprehension of Captain Mortimer and we have
so ordered.”</p>

<p>Kearns visibly expressed his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Captain Mortimer,” continued the King, “has,
we are aware, performed gallant military service
and his arrest has been so ordered as to preserve due
secrecy and not injure his career should it develop,
as you pretend, that a mistake has been made.”</p>

<p>“It most assuredly has, Sire,” replied Kearns.</p>

<p>“When you are prepared to furnish proof of that
fact,” rejoined the King, “the order can be rescinded.
Until then it will stand. It behooves you
to hasten. We leave for our City Palace to-day but
shall return here to-morrow. It would meet our
pleasure and win our approval should you be prepared
to furnish such proof, or other report, by to-morrow.”
With these words the King signified that
the interview was at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Somewhat downcast Kearns retired to the room
assigned him off the Chancellerie. The end of his
rope seemed near at hand. Here was the King insisting
on a report on the next day and here he was
practically without news. He looked wistfully, as
he had so often looked during the past few days, at
the little aërestograph. Ah, if it would only bring
its message!</p>

<p>Kearns regretted that Captain Mortimer should
have been brought under suspicion so undeservedly.
Lord Ashley was apparently playing a peculiar game.
He wondered what that game might be. He decided
it would be well to see Lord Ashley and possibly
gain some further light on the subject.</p>

<p>With another wistful glance at the aërestograph,
he walked to the door connecting his room with the
main room of the Chancellerie. He opened the door,
pushed aside the heavy portiere hanging before it and
passed in. Lord Ashley proved to be engaged at
the moment, but requested that he return in half an
hour.</p>

<p>Kearns accordingly made his way back to his room.
As he entered he halted abruptly and his heart gave
a great bound. The aërestograph was vigorously
signaling for someone to receive a message.</p>

<p>With an effort he controlled his excitement, ran
to the instrument and signaled back. Communication
established, Dean’s message began to come. His
recent interview with the King in mind, Kearns sent
back the warning message.</p>

<p>In his excitement Kearns could hardly refrain
from executing a few fancy steps. This very night
amid the sheltering trees at the further end of the
Queen’s Walk, he would know all! Truly, the news
came in the nick of time! At last fortune was smiling
sweetly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>It was with buoyant spirits that Kearns went to
his interview with Lord Ashley half an hour later.
The Chancellor met him coldly and proved extremely
reticent. Finally Kearns touched upon the subject
of Captain Mortimer and assured him that he was
making a serious mistake in his accusation. Lord
Ashley listened to his assurances with cold cynicism.
He replied shortly that he well knew what he was
doing and would be personally answerable for any
mistakes made. At this reply, Mr. Kearns felt himself
growing warm behind the ears and somewhat
brusquely rejoined that in this particular case the
noble lord did not know what he was doing. To this
Milord Ashley retorted with a sneer that he believed
one would not need to know much concerning Captain
Mortimer to be in possession of more information on
the subject than Mr. Kearns held.</p>

<p>“Ah, you really think so!” exclaimed Kearns, becoming
suddenly cool. “It is as serious a mistake
as the other.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” retorted Lord Ashley with the same
sneer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined Kearns, “and it may interest you
to learn that I have within the past few minutes been
in direct communication with Captain Mortimer.
It is only a question of hours when he will present
himself here to confront you and answer to the
King!”</p>

<p>And while the expression of astonishment which
this very positive announcement created still lingered
upon Lord Ashley’s features, Mr. Kearns bowed
politely and with a satisfied and triumphant smile
withdrew.</p>

<p>Punctual to the stroke, he repaired at midnight to
the appointed spot at the end of the Queen’s Walk
and found Mortimer and Dean already awaiting him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“When did you arrive?” asked Kearns, after the
first greetings.</p>

<p>“Only a few minutes ago,” answered the Professor.
“We came back very slowly, purposely delaying
our arrival until after nightfall, in accordance
with your instructions.”</p>

<p>“And what have you done with the air-ship?”</p>

<p>“We had to descend within the park itself,” replied
Dean, “otherwise we could not have got past
the sentries. The air-ship is concealed among the
trees near the river. It will be safe enough until
morning.”</p>

<p>Without further delay, Mortimer and Dean told
Kearns all the events in connection with their capture
and escape, and what they had learned during
their detention. All they suppressed was any information
as to the precise location of the valley.
Kearns listened intently, asking various questions.
He was now, indeed, in a position to present a completed
case! Here was information, in truth, for
His Majesty, the King! How the puny disclosures
of Milord Ashley would pale into insignificance beside
such disclosures as these!</p>

<p>Kearns, in turn, narrated the events which had occurred
at the palace since their departure—the
wounding of Captain Swords, who was rapidly recovering;
the death of the Duke of Marquanna; the
elevation of Lord Ashley to the office of Chancellor;
the investigations started and accusations launched
by the latter, and the order of arrest issued against
Mortimer.</p>

<p>The latter was naturally both astonished and indignant,
but not so much so as Dean, in the light of
his past experiences with him, would have expected.
After listening to the end of Kearns’s recital, he said
that he strongly suspected Lord Ashley of personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
motives in giving credence to these suspicions. Lord
Ashley, in his present position as Chancellor, was
possessed of a great deal of power and they must act
cleverly and cautiously. The best to be done was to
secure, as quickly as possible, an audience with the
King and explain to him all. In any event, Mortimer
insisted it was his duty to communicate promptly
to the King his knowledge of the revolutionary
movement. Whether the threatened attack took place
as predicted or not, the King must be speedily apprized.</p>

<p>But the King’s absence until the morrow made
immediate communication impossible. Kearns suggested
that Mortimer and Dean retire to a neighboring
village until the following day. Immediately
the King returned, he would arrange an interview
for Mortimer. In this plan Mortimer refused to
acquiesce. He said that as an order of arrest had
been issued against him, it was his duty, as a military
officer, to surrender at once. He did not care to play
the fugitive even for one night. Besides, he added,
what difference did it make? It was only a question
of a few hours and, although a prisoner, he would
be made as comfortable as in his own quarters and
would be treated with the consideration due to an
officer of the Guard.</p>

<p>As Mortimer could not be dissuaded from his views
on this point, it was finally decided that he should
come forward at once and subject himself to arrest
and that Kearns should return as quietly as possible
with Dean to the palace. Immediately upon the arrival
of the King upon the following day, Kearns
was to see His Majesty and impart to him such information
as would lead to Mortimer being accorded
a prompt interview.</p>

<p>This plan having been decided upon, they walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
together along the further end of the park toward
one of the entrances. Presently Mortimer stopped
and, taking leave of them, went forward alone.</p>

<p>“Who goes there!” came the challenge of the
sentinel.</p>

<p>“Officer of the Guard,” replied Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Advance, Officer of the Guard, and give the
countersign.”</p>

<p>Mortimer walked up to the sentry-box and the soldier,
recognizing his officer, smartly brought his carbine
to the salute.</p>

<p>“Send for the officer of the day,” ordered Mortimer.</p>

<p>The soldier reached into the sentry-box and touched
a signal.</p>

<p>A few moments later Captain Bingham appeared.
There was a cordial greeting on both sides and then
Captain Bingham leaned forward and whispered
something close to Mortimer’s ear.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know!” interrupted Mortimer, and arm
in arm they strolled away in the direction of the military
quarters.</p>

<small>FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“So he has returned?” said Lady Brooke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lord Ashley, “and is a prisoner.
I hold him in my grasp.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that last,” said Lady Brooke. “It
sounds vindictive. By the way, I may say frankly
that it’s well he returned just when he did. I was
beginning to grow suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Suspicious, Milady? Of what, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Of you,” retorted Lady Brooke, with unabashed
frankness. “I don’t forget that though we work together,
yet your interests in this matter are somewhat
different from mine. It would doubtless suit you
well enough if he were put out of the way for good
and all, but that’s no part of my plan. My compact
was only for a temporary injury—one that it would
be possible to repair readily.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Milady, that you always were
somewhat given to suspicion,” retorted Lord Ashley,
with a slight sneer.</p>

<p>Lady Brooke reddened and an angry light shone in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“It may be well,” she said slowly, “for you to
remember, Milord, that I expect any compact you
may make with me to be kept fully and fairly.
Chancellors may be made,” she continued with emphasis,
“and they may also be unmade, if history
records aright. I have still some influence near the
Throne, as those who care to question it may find.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“Royalty, it is said, is rarely grateful for past
favors, but I will admit there are exceptions, Milady,”
said Lord Ashley in honeyed accents.</p>

<p>“Would you care to measure how much that influence
is a matter of the past?” asked Lady Brooke,
with concentrated anger. “Would it astonish you,
perhaps, to discover that influence to be greater to-day
than ever?”</p>

<p>“Ah, a dual influence!” exclaimed Lord Ashley.
“You have in mind, no doubt, your charming protégée,
the beautiful Miss Cameron, lately presented
by you at Court and incidentally to the attention of
His Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Enough!” exclaimed Lady Brooke, her anger
flashing suddenly into flame; “since you dare——”</p>

<p>“There, there!” interrupted Lord Ashley soothingly.
“Don’t let us quarrel. I have no intention
of questioning your power, past or present, Milady,
nor do I seek to have that power turned against me.
I have enemies enough already. Won’t you now listen
to my plan?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Lady Brooke, still angry,
but grown suddenly wary.</p>

<p>“This,” said Lord Ashley: “At fifteen and a
half o’clock to-day, Captain Haslam, who is the officer
of the day, will receive an order bearing the Royal
seal, to release Captain Mortimer. This order he
will immediately execute and then proceed to destroy
the order and forget that he ever received such document.
As you know, Captain Haslam is one of my
appointees and he can be trusted implicitly to carry
out my commands. The same messenger who carries
the order of release will leave for Captain Mortimer
a letter, requesting him to proceed at once to the little
summer-house on Antler Hill, a short distance away
in the Park, where he will meet the friend who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
procured his release and learn matters of importance
to him. Do you follow me thus far, Milady?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” hastily assented Lady Brooke.</p>

<p>“Gratified over this sudden release,” continued
Lord Ashley, “and curious to ascertain who this
friend may be and what is to be imparted to him, it
is only natural to infer that Captain Mortimer will
lose no time in making his way to the rendezvous.
Needless to say that the friend he will find there will
be—you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Lady Brooke. “Continue.”</p>

<p>“You will inform him,” proceeded Lord Ashley,
“that he is the victim of a court intrigue; that the
King’s mind is poisoned against him for the time
being and that he is in serious danger; that you,
knowing this, have secured his release by a forged
order; that his only safety lies in temporary flight
and concealment and that, if he will follow your instructions,
you can surely promise him that within
two short months all danger will have disappeared,
when he will be restored to royal favor and appointed
to the Colonelcy of any one of the crack cavalry regiments
he may select—outside of the Guards. By
this plan,” continued Lord Ashley, “we both attain
our ends—the temporary removal of the gallant
Captain from the atmosphere of the Court; and you,
in addition, secure control of his person and movements
to do with him practically as you will.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he should refuse the bait?” inquired
Lady Brooke. “Suppose he elects to stay
and face the danger?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is a matter, Milady, which it seems to
me lies with you!” protested Lord Ashley. “I
really think you estimate your powers of persuasion
and of—of—attraction too lightly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“But suppose he should refuse?” persisted Lady
Brooke. “What then?”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied Lord Ashley, “I don’t see that
we shall be any worse off than before. If he refuse,
he will simply return to the military quarters and
surrender himself once more. It will be time enough
then to put our heads together and see what further
we can do, but by trying this present plan it
affords us at least a chance of success. Remember
that he must have heard something of your influence
at Court and you are certainly holding out a very
brilliant inducement to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am willing to try,” said Lady Brooke,
with determination. “We shall see what will come
of it.”</p>

<p>“And you will succeed!” declared Lord Ashley,
with conviction. “I am positive we shall both succeed!”</p>

<p>Lady Brooke had been gone but a few minutes
when Captain Haslam was announced.</p>

<p>“Captain Haslam,” said Lord Ashley, “at fifteen
and a half o’clock to-day, or perhaps even a little
earlier, an order will be presented to you for the release
of Captain Stanley Mortimer, accompanied with
a letter for him. You will have that letter delivered
to him at once and you will immediately release the
prisoner. The instant he leaves the quarters, you
will destroy the order and, under any and all circumstances,
you will forever forget that such an order has
ever reached your hands. Whenever the question
comes up as to the disposition of this prisoner, he
has escaped. You clearly understand?”</p>

<p>“I clearly understand, Milord,” answered Captain
Haslam, as he saluted and retired.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley’s next visitor was Captain Bagley.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said Lord Ashley abruptly, “you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
called upon for a certain service of state, such as
occasionally arises in the affairs of government.
Upon your faithful and discreet performance of that
service depends the matter of future favors and promotion.”</p>

<p>Captain Bagley bowed low, maintaining a respectful
silence.</p>

<p>“Your orders are these,” continued Lord Ashley:
“At fifteen o’clock to-day you will proceed to a point
in the park where you can observe the summer-house
upon Antler Hill. Conceal yourself from observation
among the trees, or bushes. At about fifteen
and three-quarters o’clock you will observe an escaped
prisoner walking along the Stag Walk toward Antler
Hill. That escaped prisoner will be Captain Stanley
Mortimer. Permit him to proceed to Antler
Hill, where he will be met by a certain personage,
whom it is not your concern to recognize. Should
he leave Antler Hill in company with that personage,
you will permit him to go unhindered on his way.
Should he leave alone and seek to return in the direction
of the military quarters, or the palace, then your
instructions are different. Do you understand thus
far?”</p>

<p>“Fully, Milord!” answered Captain Bagley.</p>

<p>“Should he start to return,” continued Lord Ashley,
“he cannot possibly do so until sixteen o’clock,
or later. The moment sixteen o’clock has sounded
and you find him upon the return journey, you will
come upon him and shoot him dead. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Fully!” repeated Captain Bagley.</p>

<p>“Your excuse will be that he was an escaping
prisoner and that your life was in danger. For the
rest, you may look to me to protect you fully in your
action.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>Captain Bagley bowed.</p>

<p>“You notice here,” continued Lord Ashley, pointing
to an instrument beside the wall, with a large
reflector above it, “the sigmagraph. As you know,
it is used to signal the guard house to turn out a
guard of honor and salute when some visitor of rank
is about to leave the Chancellerie. Five flashes of
the sigmagraph are the signal for the guard; any
smaller number are mere test signals. At sixteen
o’clock, precisely to the last stroke, you will turn
your eyes to the signal receiver upon the roof of the
military quarters. Should no signal come, you will
follow out the instructions given. Should you notice
three flashes from the sigmagraph, then your orders
are cancelled and the escaping prisoner is to be permitted
to pass unhindered. Are these instructions
clear to you?”</p>

<p>“Entirely, Milord!” answered Captain Bagley.</p>

<p>“And I can count upon your faithful and discreet
performance?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, Milord!”</p>

<p>“It is well, then,” said Lord Ashley. “Remember
that neither His Majesty, nor the Chancellerie,
is unmindful of service and that due reward attends
those who serve His Majesty and His Majesty’s Government
faithfully and well. No better service can
be done than to exterminate, if needs be, traitors and
hatchers of treason. I make myself clear to you in
this?”</p>

<p>“Nothing could be clearer, Milord!”</p>

<p>“It would not astonish me, Captain, to see you one
day at the head of a Division.”</p>

<p>“I shall ever strive to earn your approval, Milord
Chancellor!” replied Captain Bagley, as he saluted
and retired.</p>

<p>While Lord Ashley was thus occupied in issuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
instructions Mr. Kearns was busily engaged in endeavoring
to get in touch with the King. After diligent
inquiry, he ascertained that His Majesty had
left the City Palace and was then upon the return
journey. It was, however, not His Majesty’s intention
to return direct, but to stop en route at Fairoaks,
the country estate of Sir Foxhall Sharpe, some thirty
miles from the Summer Palace, where a garden-party
to be attended by the King, the Queen and the Court
was to be held that afternoon. It was rumored in
Court circles that the real attraction of the garden-party
was a certain Miss Cameron, to whom recently
had been drawn the attention of the King. The
Queen, it was said, had in consequence of the presence
of this Miss Cameron among the guests been
with difficulty induced to lend her presence, only
consenting finally in order to prevent the appearance
of a public scandal.</p>

<p>Kearns secured a phaeromobile from the royal
garage and hurried off to Fairoaks, passing as he went
a number of court mobiles on the way to the garden-party.
Reaching Fairoaks, he found that the King
had arrived, but had retired to rest after his journey.
His Majesty had given orders that he was not to be
disturbed.</p>

<p>It was only after a long and weary wait of more
than two hours that Kearns succeeded in getting his
urgent message to the King. His Majesty sent for
him at once, but received him with some show of
impatience.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the King, “we assume that your case
is completed at last and that it must be both interesting
and important to be forced upon our attention
at the present time!”</p>

<p>“The case is fully completed, Sire,” answered
Kearns, “and in importance will not, I think, disappoint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
your expectations. I am prepared to report
now.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” interrupted the King. “We would
prefer to learn the details at the palace—upon our
return.”</p>

<p>“But the matters I have to impart, Sire, are most
pressing—most urgent!”</p>

<p>“So are matters here,” exclaimed the King, with
a peculiar smile. “Certain rumors—as wicked as
they are unfounded—have, it has reached our ears,
been set afloat and have deeply shocked us. It has
become necessary by our presence here, and that of
Her Majesty, to discountenance these scandalous
gossipings.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kearns could accommodate his intelligence to
that which was required of him as well as the next
man. He accordingly contrived to inject into his
countenance the necessary quantum of astonishment
and indignation and having done this, he promptly
returned to the charge.</p>

<p>“It becomes my duty to report to you, Sire,” he
said, “that danger threatens and that an armed attack
is projected.”</p>

<p>It was the King’s turn to look startled and astonished.</p>

<p>“When?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Possibly within three days.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of this?”</p>

<p>“Positive!”</p>

<p>“And can you confirm your facts?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Through Captain Stanley Mortimer and another.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of this?”</p>

<p>“Entirely so.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>The King remained for a moment in deep thought.</p>

<p>“Three days,” he murmured. “That will give
all the time required for any concentration of our
forces which may be necessary. Two hours cannot
make much difference in these preparations. We
will remain here for that time and then return to
the palace.”</p>

<p>“In view of the character of my information,”
persisted Kearns, “I urge you, Sire, to the utmost
expedition. I beg you to release Captain Mortimer
at once and to send for him and hear his story.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the King, “to leave here thus
suddenly would create much undesirable speculation
and gossip. This you shall do. We will sign the
order for Captain Mortimer’s release, which you
shall bear to him at once. Direct him to repair to
the palace and hold himself in readiness for an immediate
audience. When you have done this, you
will hasten back here and report. By that time we
shall be prepared to return to our palace and listen
to the full details of this news. You may now go
and carry out these instructions.”</p>

<p>“You have not yet given me, Sire, the order for
Captain Mortimer’s release.”</p>

<p>The King crossed to a writing-table, hastily wrote
the requisite order and handed it to Kearns.</p>

<p>“We would not lightly affront our Chancellor,”
he said. “You will, therefore, keep Captain Mortimer
discreetly out of sight until our return and until
we have gathered from his story whether this release
is fully warranted by the facts. Should you chance
to meet our Chancellor, tell him nothing of this release,
but bid him summon General Pierson, in
command of the First Army Corps, to the palace.
Go now, and upon your return here you will find us
fully ready to proceed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>Kearns bowed and retired. He made his way
through the gardens, and, stepping into his phaeromobile,
started on the return journey to the palace.</p>

<p>As Mr. Kearns passed through the gardens of Fairoaks,
he had noticed among the guests Miss Dorothy
Brandon and Miss Beatrice Cuming. They also had
seen him and had bowed. Just as Kearns passed out
of the grounds, Lady Hill, one of Her Majesty’s
ladies-in-waiting, came hurrying forward and greeted
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“I have been looking all over for you,” said Lady
Hill. “I bring you an order from the Queen.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” answered Dorothy. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“You are to return at once to the palace,” said
Lady Hill, “and present yourself at the Chancellerie.
The Chancellor desires to see you upon urgent matters.”</p>

<p>Dorothy seemed both startled and astonished.</p>

<p>“The Chancellor desires to see me!” she exclaimed.
“What can it be about? I would prefer
not to go.”</p>

<p>“Not go!” answered Lady Hill, who was a great
stickler for etiquette, evidently quite shocked.
“Why, my dear, this is a royal command I bring
you.”</p>

<p>“But what can the Chancellor want to see me
about?” persisted Dorothy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Lady Hill, “except that
it is a matter of state. The Chancellor’s request was
addressed to the Queen, in the usual form—you being
attached to Her Majesty’s suite—and the Chancellor
urgently asks your attendance at once. The
Queen, of course, immediately gave this order which
I bring you.”</p>

<p>“I would much prefer not to go,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p>“But for what reason?” demanded Lady Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“Oh, it would be much nicer to remain here,” answered
Dorothy vaguely. “Don’t you think I might
seek audience with the Queen and ask her to withdraw
the order?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” said Lady Hill severely.
“Such a proceeding would be entirely improper and
contrary to Court etiquette.”</p>

<p>“Well, but could I not,” persisted Dorothy, “endeavor
to arrange this matter, whatever it is, with the
Chancellor over the audiphone?”</p>

<p>“I am not familiar with the etiquette of the Chancellor,”
said Lady Hill frostily; “but I fancy that
the Chancellor does not usually discuss matters of
state over the audiphone. As a maid of honor attached
to Her Majesty’s suite, it is your duty not to
quibble over the orders of the Sovereign, but to obey.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Dorothy resignedly. “I
shall go at once. Will you come with me, Trixy?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear,” replied Beatrice.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we have to go,” remarked Dorothy as
they made their way through the grounds. “I understand
there is going to be a splendid entertainment
given later in the afternoon under the supervision
of Sir Richard Hollowboy, the famous Director of
Plastics.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is indeed too bad!” assented Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Dorothy, “I did my best to get
out of it.”</p>

<p>“You certainly did,” acquiesced Beatrice, “but
there’s no escape. Well, don’t let’s mind! What
can’t be cured must be endured, I suppose!”</p>

<p>They reached the highway, stepped into their victoriamobile
and were off. And thus it happened that
the two ladies were following Mr. Kearns on the
highway leading back to the palace.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Kearns he traveled back at a rate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
speed which, unused as he was to such celerity in an
open vehicle of this description, suggested to him
ideas that should any sudden breakdown, or other mishap
occur there would be little left of him or the
vehicle from which to pick out the tale. He experienced,
however, a sense of buoyancy and exhilaration
from this rapid flashing through the air. He was
glad, though, of the wise provision which divided the
Northbound and Southbound roads, thus obviating at
least any possibility of collision.</p>

<p>Without accident or further adventure he reached
the Palace Park and springing out of the phaeromobile,
he ordered the man in charge to hold himself
in readiness for the return journey to Fairoaks.
Striding rapidly toward the military quarters, he was
within a few steps of the main entrance when, to his
unbounded astonishment, he saw advancing toward
him Captain Stanley Mortimer.</p>

<p>“How is it you are here?” exclaimed Mr. Kearns
in amazement.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been favored with an order of release,”
said Mortimer, smiling.</p>

<p>“How did you manage it?” asked Kearns.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know, except that the order was
from the King,” answered Mortimer. “But come
this way; I’ve something to show you.”</p>

<p>He passed his arm through that of Kearns and
led him a short distance away from the military
quarters and out into the park.</p>

<p>“This whole affair has happened in a most curious
way,” he said. “A few minutes ago I was
notified of the arrival of the order of release and
at the same time this note was given me. It’s
really quite curious! Read for yourself!”</p>

<p>Kearns took the paper handed to him and read:</p>

<p>“When these lines reach you, they will be accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
by an order for your release. This order
has been secured by a true and devoted friend, who
desires to see you at once for the purpose of conveying
to you information which it is of the highest
importance you should learn at once. The moment
you are released proceed to the summer-house on
Antler Hill, where you will find this friend anxiously
awaiting you. You ought to reach there by
sixteen o’clock or a little earlier.”</p>

<p>Twice Mr. Kearns read the note over carefully
and then paused thoughtfully for some moments.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said at last.</p>

<p>“Well—what?” exclaimed Captain Mortimer
questioningly.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Kearns.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Mortimer in some astonishment,
“I’m going to Antler Hill, I suppose. Why
should I not go?”</p>

<p>“Because I scent a trap of some kind!” replied
Kearns with conviction.</p>

<p>“A trap!” exclaimed Mortimer. “You do, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m astonished,” exclaimed Mortimer,
“but I do not know that I should hold back. If
a friend awaits me there, I wouldn’t like to appear
ungrateful, and if it is, as you suspect, an enemy,
I’ve never yet hesitated to meet my enemies. What
makes you think it is a trap?”</p>

<p>“Why so much mystery about this missive?
Why is it unsigned? Why should this friend conceal
his name from you?” asked Kearns vehemently.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Mortimer musingly, “there is
some force in what you say, and yet one can imagine
reasons why a friend might not sign such a communication,
especially when his identity is about
to be revealed in the course of an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“You say the order of release was from the
King?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I can assure you,” continued Kearns earnestly,
“there is something wrong about this whole
transaction. I have here, as you see, an order for
your release given direct into my hands by the King.
I came here in all haste the moment after receiving
it. I am convinced that the King has issued no other
order of the same kind and that there is something
wrong in connection with that other order which released
you.”</p>

<p>“This looks indeed strange!” admitted Mortimer,
with a serious air.</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” resumed Kearns, “when the
King gave me that order, it was entrusted to me
with the condition that I keep you quietly in the
background until the King received you in audience
and judged matters for himself. I accepted the order
under this condition and I feel bound by it.”</p>

<p>“That entirely alters the complexion of matters,”
declared Mortimer. “I would not willingly by any
act of mine place you in a false position. But won’t
you go to Antler Hill and explain to the person who
may be waiting there why it is I am unable to
appear in person? Any danger which may await
me would surely not extend to you.”</p>

<p>“I would only too gladly go,” replied Kearns,
“but I’m ordered to return to the King as soon as
I have you in readiness for the coming audience.
I don’t care to send another to the summer-house,
though I am most curious to learn who may be the
person awaiting you there.”</p>

<p>“And so am I!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry,” retorted Kearns. “Friend
or foe, you may depend upon it we shall discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
who that person is before long. As you know, I
have had some experience in matters of this kind.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then, you wish me to do now?”
asked Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Accompany me to the palace,” replied Kearns.
“I shall leave you in my private bureau in the
Chancellerie until the time comes for your audience
with the King.”</p>

<p>“I am at your disposition,” answered Mortimer
simply.</p>

<p>“One question I want to ask you,” said Kearns.
“Have you communicated with anybody since your
return?”</p>

<p>“With no one,” replied Mortimer. “I was naturally
not anxious to advertise the fact of my being
under arrest.”</p>

<p>“That was very wise,” remarked Kearns. “Now
let us go.”</p>

<p>They accordingly made their way direct to the
palace and entered Kearns’s bureau off the main
room of the Chancellerie.</p>

<p>“Now,” exclaimed Kearns, “I invite you to make
yourself as comfortable as possible here until audience
time comes. It will be only a couple of hours
or so.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” assented Mortimer cheerfully.</p>

<p>“More than this,” continued Kearns, “knowing
your propensity for running into adventures of various
kinds and in view of my promise to the King,
I am going to ask you to pledge me your word of
honor that you won’t leave this room during the next
two hours.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” demurred Mortimer, smiling; “that’s a
hard promise to exact. Who can tell what may turn
up within two hours?”</p>

<p>“Well,” assented Kearns, “I will allow you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
make your promise with the qualification: Except
in case of possible life or death. I have, then, your
word?”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way, since you insist,” exclaimed
Mortimer. “Yes; you have my word that
I will not cross the threshold of this room within the
next two hours, unless it is a question of possible
life or death.”</p>

<p>“Now I can proceed upon my errand with a mind
at ease,” said Kearns, with a satisfied air. “Oh,
by the way, I had almost forgotten! I have a message
from the King for Lord Ashley.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he walked to the door of communication,
pushed aside the heavy portiere, opened the
door, threw aside the corresponding portiere on the
other side and passed into the main room of the
Chancellerie.</p>

<p>A moment later he returned, with preoccupied air.</p>

<p>“Nobody there!” he exclaimed. “It’s a holiday
and everybody has taken advantage of it. Well, I’m
off to Fairoaks now. Within two hours I expect I
shall be back and—so will the King!” With these
words he hurried from the room and away.</p>

<p>After Kearns’s departure, Mortimer strolled to the
window and looked over the park. Then he stretched
himself out comfortably with a book and read. He
had been reading but a very short time, when voices
came to him from the adjoining main room of the
Chancellerie. An instant later he sprang to his feet,
a flood of color flushing his face. In returning from
the Chancellerie to his bureau, Mr. Kearns had
failed fully to close the door of communication and
now only the two portieres intervened between the
rooms. Do what he would, Mortimer could not but
hear.</p>

<p>More distinctly came the voices to him, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
minutes passed. He stood with strained features and
eyes ablaze. Then his hand flew to his sword-hilt
and he strode forward. Two steps he took and
abruptly halted.</p>

<p>Merciful God! Why was he thus chained here?
Why had he pledged his word, except under stress of
possible life or death, not to cross the threshold of
this room?</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>IN THE CHANCELLERIE</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“His Excellency, the Chancellor, desires to see
Miss Brandon upon official business and alone,” said
the messenger.</p>

<p>“You will wait for me, Trixy?” asked Dorothy
of her companion.</p>

<p>“I have a letter to send off, dear,” answered Beatrice,
“and I will go to your desk and write it. I
suppose you will be back to me before I have
finished.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” assented Dorothy, with preoccupied
air, as she turned to the messenger and indicated her
readiness to follow him.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley received her in the main room of the
Chancellerie. The messenger who ushered her in
withdrew, and they were alone.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley advanced with deferential courtesy
to receive her and led her to a seat at the head of a
long, highly-polished table in the centre of the room.
He drew up a chair and seated himself at the side of
the table, in order to bring himself almost face to face
with her.</p>

<p>“I must beg your forgiveness, Miss Brandon,” he
began, “for having thus hastily asked your attendance.
I trust you will not regret too much having
missed the pleasures of the garden-party.”</p>

<p>“I confess,” answered Dorothy, “I was astonished
upon learning the urgency of your summons
and quite unable to guess its cause. Even now I—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“You are still at a loss,” rejoined Lord Ashley
promptly, as she hesitated. “It may be summed
up in two words—official business.”</p>

<p>“Official business!” repeated Dorothy. “So the
message said. But what possible connection can
there be between me and the official business of the
Chancellerie?”</p>

<p>“It does seem peculiar, doesn’t it?” laughed Lord
Ashley pleasantly, “but that is precisely what I am
about to explain to you. There is a matter regarding
which you can, perhaps, furnish me with some information—information
which has only an indirect
bearing, no doubt, but which may possibly be of some
value to His Majesty’s Government.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? To what does this matter relate?”</p>

<p>“It is connected with the recent disappearance of
Captain Stanley Mortimer.”</p>

<p>Dorothy started and perceptibly changed color.</p>

<p>“You astonish me!” she exclaimed. “In what
way can I possibly assist you in this?”</p>

<p>“You remember the occasion of the last Court
ball?” asked Lord Ashley.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That night was also the occasion of the wounding
of Captain Swords and of the disappearance of
Captain Mortimer, as you will recall.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The last known appearance in public of Captain
Mortimer,” continued Lord Ashley, “was at the
ball, where he had the honor of dancing with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he danced with me.”</p>

<p>“After which,” resumed Lord Ashley, “you both
made the customary promenade and conversed together.”</p>

<p>“We passed into the royal conservatory.”</p>

<p>“So that,” said Lord Ashley, with a pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
smile, “you are the last person with whom Captain
Mortimer is known to have been seen on that eventful
night.”</p>

<p>“I was not aware of that.”</p>

<p>“Such is the case, however.”</p>

<p>“Well, even so, what then——?”</p>

<p>“Simply this,” replied Lord Ashley, with the
same pleasant smile; “it has been deemed advisable
to ask you if, in the course of his conversation with
you that evening, Captain Mortimer permitted any
remarks to fall which would tend to throw light upon
his subsequent disappearance.”</p>

<p>Dorothy paused, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Was he not engaged that night upon some special
service for the King?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Engaged upon special service for the King!”
exclaimed Lord Ashley, with a mocking laugh.
“No; I regret to say that he was engaged upon very
different service.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Milord.”</p>

<p>“Then I will make myself perfectly clear,” said
Lord Ashley, with emphasis. “Far from being engaged
in His Majesty’s service that night, Captain
Mortimer was conspiring with and aiding the
enemies of the King.”</p>

<p>“Oh, monstrous!” exclaimed Dorothy with agitation.
“I am convinced there is no truth in this.”</p>

<p>“I would that I could join you in this belief,”
said Lord Ashley bitterly, “for the sake of the reputation
of the army in general and of the Guards in
particular. Unfortunately, the proofs in possession
of His Majesty’s government are conclusive. Captain
Mortimer has been led from the path of his
duty to King and Government—has been led to his
ruin—by yielding to temptations extended by the
King’s enemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“I am convinced there is some mistake,” replied
Dorothy. There was a numb sensation in her brain
and at her heart, yet she spoke the words bravely.</p>

<p>“Mistake!” repeated Lord Ashley. “Alas, no!
The Government has in its possession proofs establishing
Captain Mortimer’s connection with certain
revolutionary factions to which he has given information
and active aid. A search of his quarters subsequent
to his disappearance revealed the presence of
plans of fortifications and schedules as to the disposition
of His Majesty’s forces of a most compromising
character.”</p>

<p>Dorothy had recovered from the first shock of the
Chancellor’s disclosures and all her senses were now
alert.</p>

<p>“It does not seem probable,” she said slowly,
“that a person about to disappear would leave all
these compromising matters behind, when it would
have been so easy to have destroyed them.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” retorted Lord Ashley quickly, “but this
disappearance was not premeditated. The necessity
for it arose suddenly and in an unforeseen manner.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Lord Ashley. “Captain Mortimer
was involved in the various scandalous attempts
which have been made at times upon the peace
and dignity of His Majesty—attempts involving the
depositing of threatening and seditious documents
in the royal apartments. Upon the occasion of the
last of these attempts, Captain Mortimer had reason
to believe he was recognized and his acts discovered
by the officer on duty that night; hence the attempted
assassination of Captain Swords and the sudden disappearance
which followed.”</p>

<p>Dorothy sank back in her chair, white and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“Ah!” she exclaimed with emotion, “you accuse
him of murder as well as of treason!”</p>

<p>“Such are the facts to which the proofs in the
possession of the Government point,” answered Lord
Ashley impressively.</p>

<p>“But,” said Dorothy, gathering her courage and
fighting on bravely, “what possible motive could
Captain Mortimer have for doing these things? He
is a soldier with a brilliant record; he holds an enviable
position in the army; why should he do these
things? What motive could there be?”</p>

<p>“There are circumstances and temptations which
lie so far apart from you and your life, Miss Brandon,”
said Lord Ashley with an air of great candor,
“that they are difficult to explain to you, and it is
not wonderful that you should not understand them.
These revolutionary movements are backed by men
of large means, who have their own personal aims
and ambitions. In addition to this, there are the subscriptions
of disaffected masses which, when lumped
together, run into vast sums. The Reactionist cause,
I can assure you, does not lack money.”</p>

<p>“I follow your words, but I don’t fully understand
their import,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p>“I will be more explicit,” rejoined Lord Ashley.
“You asked me what could be the motive for Captain
Mortimer’s acts, and I answer you by saying
that there are ample funds at the disposition of these
revolutionists, who do not hesitate to purchase
treason. Money—that magnet of temptation which
has led astray so many men—was the motive. Captain
Mortimer, like many other officers of the army,
was addicted to heavy play; he was pressed for money
and it was with money that he was debauched.”</p>

<p>“Are there no limits to the calumnies—no depths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
to the infamies charged?” cried Dorothy with indignation
and despair.</p>

<p>“It does sound infamous,” replied Lord Ashley
gravely, “so infamous as to seem, to an upright mind
like yours, almost incredible. But such are the facts,
and these facts, as I have already had the honor of apprizing
you, are supported by proofs in the possession
of the Government.”</p>

<p>“But so-called proof at times turns out to be
error,” retorted Dorothy.</p>

<p>“There are, it is true, various grades of proof,”
replied Lord Ashley with judicial solemnity. “In
this case, the proofs in the hands of the Government
are convincing. They are absolute and incontestable.
There is no error.”</p>

<p>For one brief instant Dorothy sat irresolute. Here
was the Chancellor of the Empire—a man of responsibility
and power—assuring her that there were incontestable
proofs of guilt. He told, with judicial
calmness and force, a story detailed and circumstantial
of conspiracy and treason and the motive therefor.
For the second time this tale of passion for play
had reached her. What was she to believe? What
should be her decision? Ah! the answer to her was
easy; only for the briefest instant did she hesitate!
How false the first accusation had proved! Had he
not looked into her eyes, in the gardens of the King,
and had she not felt that only honor and truth lay
behind his refuting words? How she had reproached
herself then for her lack of faith! Never
again would she dishonor him with one thought of
mistrust. Let circumstances be what they would,
let suspicion point as it might, never again would she
permit herself the slightest doubt! She raised her
head and looked keenly at Lord Ashley.</p>

<p>“During this interview,” she said, “you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
spoken of treason, of attempted murder and of mercenariness.
You say there are proofs of these things.
I can only answer you that I am convinced these
proofs are false. Does Captain Swords, for instance,
assert that it was Captain Mortimer who fired that
shot?”</p>

<p>“Captain Swords did not see his assailant, although
his assailant doubtless thought he did,”
answered Lord Ashley. “Besides, Captain Swords
is as deceived as to the true character of Captain
Mortimer as others have been.”</p>

<p>“You will have to count me, then, among the
friends who believe steadfastly in him as the soul of
loyalty and honor!” said Dorothy with spirit. “I
don’t suppose,” she continued, “I can dissuade you
from the opinions you have formed, and I am very
sure that you cannot change mine on this subject. It
is painful to me to hear one whom I respect falsely
accused, and I don’t see what can well be gained by
further discussing this matter. In fact, Milord, I
don’t quite understand why—why—this interview
was sought.”</p>

<p>“I have already tendered my apologies,” replied
Lord Ashley gently, “and explained that you were
the last person with whom Captain Mortimer was
seen. The Government is desirous of learning
whether, during the conversation with you upon that
occasion, Captain Mortimer permitted any remark
to escape him which might throw any light upon the
matter of this disappearance, or other acts of his.”</p>

<p>“Captain Mortimer indulged in no such remark,”
answered Dorothy briefly.</p>

<p>“But you have already said that he told you he
was engaged that night upon some special service for
the King,” persisted Lord Ashley.</p>

<p>“He did say he was engaged that night upon some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
special service, but I am not sure that he added it
was for the King. That, I think, was a mere inference
on my part.”</p>

<p>“And a very natural inference under the circumstances,”
replied Lord Ashley with warmth, “but the
assertion was false!”</p>

<p>“I know nothing except the bare statement made
to me,” answered Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Will you not narrate the circumstances which
led up to that statement?” asked Lord Ashley.
“Will you not detail the entire conversation which
took place between you? You see,” he added, “there
may have been words with little meaning for you,
which nevertheless would mean much for the officers
of His Majesty’s Government, in view of the facts
which they know and the clues which they possess.”</p>

<p>Dorothy hesitated an instant.</p>

<p>“I have said to you,” she replied, “that no such
remarks passed between us.”</p>

<p>“I have explained that you are scarcely in a position
to judge accurately as to this,” went on Lord
Ashley inexorably. “Will you not repeat, for the
benefit of the Government, the conversation which
occurred, so that the Government may judge for
itself as to this matter?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Dorothy coldly. “The conversation
was of a private character—one with which the
Government has no concern. I have assured you that
no remarks such as you seek were made. Beyond
this I will not go!”</p>

<p>“Then I am to understand,” said Lord Ashley regretfully,
“that you prefer to render possible aid
to this traitor rather than to the King and Queen
from whom you hold a post of honor and whom you
profess to serve?”</p>

<p>“I reject the charge of treachery as to myself, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
do the name traitor as applied to Captain Mortimer,”
replied Dorothy with spirit. “Your insinuation of
disloyalty on my part,” she added sadly, “is unjust—undeserved.
I serve the Queen honestly and loyally.
To her I would willingly repeat what I here
refuse to say.”</p>

<p>“Do not be angry with me!” exclaimed Lord
Ashley warmly, drawing nearer to her. “I meant
no offense, but I was carried away by my feelings.
It distresses me to see you—whose regard would do
an emperor honor—place trust in and defend a renegade
and traitor—a scoundrel who has been false to
his King.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Dorothy, shrinking back, “this
is terrible! I have told you I do not believe—I do
not believe!”</p>

<p>“Listen, then,” cried Lord Ashley, pressing still
nearer, “and learn now the full truth. He has been
captured and is at this minute a prisoner—in close
confinement—in the military quarters.”</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed Dorothy with excitement, “he
will have an opportunity of speaking for himself, and
the truth will stand forth!”</p>

<p>“He has spoken! The truth is out!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He has confessed—confessed to his treason!”</p>

<p>“Impossible—oh, impossible!” cried Dorothy
distractedly.</p>

<p>“I tell you it is so,” continued Lord Ashley vehemently,
“and still more will I tell you. As a reward
for this confession, which has implicated others and
given the Government much valuable information,
and also to save the Guards’ corps from the shame of
having harbored a scoundrel and a traitor, he is not
to be made to suffer the penalty of his crimes. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
permitted an arrangement to be made for his escape,
and he has gladly acquiesced.”</p>

<p>“You say he has acquiesced to such a thing!” exclaimed
Dorothy with an air of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” retorted Lord Ashley, “and is at this moment
on his way to some place of security and oblivion.
Now, I beg you to listen to me,” he continued
with fervor. “I beseech you—I implore you—to
put from your mind all further thought of this man,
whose name is unworthy of mention in your presence.
He has merited death, but has escaped with
shame as his portion henceforth. Let us dismiss
him from our thoughts. There is another and more
honorable matter regarding which I would speak to
you. Miss Brandon—Dorothy—I love you!”</p>

<p>“Milord——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I love you,” he continued, with the abandon
of a man carried away by the force of his feelings,
“and I offer you a union which the proudest woman
in the realm might find worthy of acceptance. His
Majesty, the King, has already signified to me that
my appointment as Lord Chancellor is to be followed
shortly by my elevation to the Peerage. In fact, I
may confide to you that the form of such title has
already been selected.”</p>

<p>“Milord, I——”</p>

<p>“Nay, hear me to the end,” he continued with
passionate fervor; “it is more than mere title which
I have to offer. As wife of a Lord Chancellor who
will know how to extend the influence and power of
his high office, you will find yourself in a position of
social supremacy which will place you second only to
the Queen herself. At a word from you, social
careers will be made or marred; at a nod of approval
from you, a fashion will spring into life, or be set
aside. Men of the world and men of the Court will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
respect and fear your power, while women will fawn
and flatter for your favor. Rank, title, power, influence—all
these I offer you, and, moreover, boundless
devotion and immeasurable love. What can I
give more?”</p>

<p>He paused and waited. Dorothy sat with bowed
head and shifting color and made no sign. Could
this, Ashley wondered, be the silence of rejection, or
was it merely the hesitation natural to maidenly reserve?
Reared throughout his life among soldiers
and statesmen possessed of aims and ambitions, himself
possessed of a boundless lust for preferment and
power, Lord Ashley’s tendency was to regard ambition
as the all-alluring fetish, the resistless lever, with
which to sway human impulse and human action.
Furthermore, his actual experiences in his immediate
surroundings had tended to impress him with the
accuracy of this theory. What he had offered was
sufficiently brilliant, as he had said, to be worthy of
the acceptance of the proudest woman in the land.
Nor had he overstated his case. He was really in a
position to give all he tendered. She would surely
not refuse! What woman would? At last she spoke.</p>

<p>“I fully realize, Milord, the extent of all you have
been good enough to offer me,” she said, “and I appreciate
the honor you do me. I am glad, too, to
learn of the new distinctions which await you and
pleased to be the first to congratulate you.”</p>

<p>“And you accept?” he cried joyfully, as he bent
nearer to her. “You will say—yes?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she exclaimed hastily, as she shrunk
back; “I cannot—I cannot—accept.”</p>

<p>“You—cannot—accept!” he cried blankly.
“And—why?”</p>

<p>She remained silent.</p>

<p>“Why?” he repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>Still there was no answer.</p>

<p>“You are not pledged to another?”</p>

<p>“Surely that is something you should not ask.”</p>

<p>“But I do ask it,” he cried vehemently, springing
to his feet, his face pale with anger. “Do you think
I am blind—that I cannot surmise! You have been
bewitched by that traitor whose crimes I have laid
bare before you. In spite of his misdeeds and his
shame, you still cling to a mad infatuation, a wild
hope, instead of accepting an honorable union. It is
the perversity which has marked and marred so
many of your sex through the ages. But I am not a
man to be thus flaunted and put aside. This silly
infatuation, this foolish love of yours can never be
realized, for it is given to one who is dead!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” repeated Dorothy, turning pale to the
lips. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ll tell you!” said Lord Ashley, beside
himself with anger. “This man deserved death, but
the Government, on the score of policy, was opposed
to the notoriety arising from his public trial and execution.
It was accordingly decided that he should
be afforded opportunities of escape and that he should
either be allowed to gain his freedom and hide his
perfidy and shame in some obscure corner of the
world, or else that the death he so well merited
should be dealt out to him while effecting this escape—in
other words, a private execution of justice in
place of a public one. This question was referred to
certain officers of the Government, who in turn left
the whole question to me. In the goodness of my
heart, I wavered and delayed my decision until the
last moment, making the execution dependent upon
a certain signal to be given by me. At this very moment
the man is escaping. His life depends upon
the signal which I shall give.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>“But this is murder!” cried Dorothy desperately,
springing to her feet.</p>

<p>“It is a judicial execution,” said Lord Ashley
sternly, “and one that would be approved by every
army officer and every loyalist in the country were
the facts known.”</p>

<p>“I will shout this infamy broadcast,” cried Dorothy,
wild-eyed and gasping.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed Lord Ashley with sarcasm,
“your utterances will be known merely as the wild
ravings of an infatuated woman! What will they
weigh against official declarations and the military
reports as to the escape and what followed? Such
utterances will simply bring notoriety and discredit
upon you.”</p>

<p>“Have you no mercy?”</p>

<p>“None,” he answered inflexibly. “Hear me now
for the last time. That instrument against the wall
yonder is a sigmagraph. A touch of its electric button
causes a flash of light to appear upon the reflector
above it, which is transmitted to the receiver upon
the roof of the military quarters. In just eight and
one-half minutes, sixteen o’clock will sound. If, before
the last stroke dies away, three flashes of light
are cast from that reflector, mercy will have prevailed
and the traitor will be permitted to make good his
escape. If no such signal be given he dies.”</p>

<p>“This is horrible—horrible!” repeated Dorothy,
aghast “You will surely show mercy and not hold
back that signal!”</p>

<p>“Only upon one condition.”</p>

<p>“And that is?” cried Dorothy desperately.</p>

<p>“I am but human,” said Lord Ashley, speaking
rapidly, “and to purchase my happiness I will forego
meting out strict justice. In the palace chapel, at
this very moment, is the royal chaplain. At a command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
from me he can be in this room within two
minutes; within two more the words can be spoken
which will constitute a binding ceremony. The brilliant
public ceremony can come later. Speak but the
word. I will summon the chaplain and—this man
lives. His fate is in your hands!”</p>

<p>“No, no!” protested Dorothy, “I cannot—cannot!”</p>

<p>“Then he dies!”</p>

<p>Lord Ashley turned aside. He drew a cigarette-case
from his pocket, extracted a cigarette and, crossing
the room to a side table, lighted it. Walking
over to the sigmagraph, he took up his post with his
back turned to it.</p>

<p>“Four minutes only are left to you,” he said ominously,
as he drew out his watch.</p>

<p>His words came to his listener as an electric
shock. She roused herself from her momentary
lethargy and despair.</p>

<p>“Will you not be moved to justice?” she cried.
“Don’t you see that what you ask cannot be? I could
never know happiness—never make you happy. I
should forever have this scene before my eyes—this
scene of blood—of treachery!”</p>

<p>“I have told you it is a judicial execution—none
the less judicial and proper because justice is meted
out privately rather than publicly. High affairs of
state under all governments not infrequently demand
such a course—a course which in reality shows undeserved
mercy to him.”</p>

<p>“Mercy! mercy! This you call mercy!”</p>

<p>“It is the only mercy I will show him, unless——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say this! You will not permit this wicked,
treacherous deed! You will save him! You will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
give the signal—say that you will give the signal!”</p>

<p>“Three minutes!”</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t count. You drive me mad! Is
there nothing will move you to pity—nothing turn
you from this——”</p>

<p>“I’ve already told you. His fate lies with you!”</p>

<p>“No, no—not that! This cannot—must not be!
Anything but that——”</p>

<p>“Then it is you who condemn him by your own
act!”</p>

<p>“My own act! I, who would gladly die to save
him! But no, it is not my act—not my act! I cannot—I
will not do what will bring horror, misery,
degradation!”</p>

<p>“You speak of a union with the Chancellor of the
Realm as degradation?”</p>

<p>“A union with any man when a woman’s whole
heart and soul are given to another means misery,
degradation. How can you ask it of me—how yourself
consent! For I love him—I love him—I love
only him!”</p>

<p>“Two minutes!”</p>

<p>“You don’t realize—you don’t understand! I
tell you no, no, this cannot—this must not be. Anything
else you ask, but not that! For your own happiness
spare me—for your own conscience—your
own future peace, save him!”</p>

<p>“Not all the angels in heaven, or devils in hell,
shall turn me from my path! You are sacrificing
everything to a woman’s whim. Time will teach you
forgetfulness of this folly and—love!”</p>

<p>“A woman’s whim! Ah, the wise Chancellor understands
so little of women that he thinks them mere
butterflies. But I say to you that when a woman’s
spirit is once profoundly stirred, she becomes more
firm, more implacable, than the sternest man among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
you all! Her love knows no measure, no reason, no
calculation; her hate has no weakening. Were I to
become your wife, I could never forget that the man
I adore had been torn from me by force and fraud.
My thoughts would always be of him; my only moments
of happiness those when I closed my eyes and
cheated my senses with the dream that I lay within
his arms. The honor, the rank, the titles you offer
me, would be nothing, for would they not have been
bought at the price of his—of my—happiness! And
you—I should hate you!”</p>

<p>“Less than one minute!”</p>

<p>“Less than one minute! And you will permit this
crime! You will let him go to his death—my
sweetheart—my handsome, gallant sweetheart! No,
you will not! You are too noble, too generous!”</p>

<p>“You cannot move me!”</p>

<p>“Do you not see that I shall go mad if you kill
him? Say that you will give the signal—that you
will give the signal!”</p>

<p>“Your last moment of opportunity is rapidly
passing. Will you save him?”</p>

<p>“O God—my God!”</p>

<p>“Hear! the hour strikes!”</p>

<p>“The signal—the signal! Give the signal!”</p>

<p>“Not unless you pledge yourself before the last
stroke sounds.”</p>

<p>“The signal!”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“A-a-h!”</p>

<p>With a scream she turned suddenly and ran from
him to the little table upon which stood the electric
lighter. Over her shoulders was a light, loose scarf,
which she had worn as part of her garden-party costume.
She tore it from her and thrust it into the
flame of the electric lighter. In an instant the delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
material had caught the flames and, before Lord
Ashley could divine her intention, she rushed to the
sigmagraph’s indicator and upon its sensitized surface
flashed the light thrice; but not before her gown
at sleeves and bosom caught in flame.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley, recovering from the first shock of
surprise, sprang toward her, dashed the burning scarf
to the floor and with a few rapid movements smothered
the flames at work upon her frock.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” he cried staring at the
injury to her dainty white flesh. “Do you realize
that you have placed your life in peril?”</p>

<p>She was dazed and half fainting from the pain of
her injuries, and he supported her to a divan at the
further end of the apartment.</p>

<p>“Do you realize what you have done?” he repeated.</p>

<p>But despite the pain, despite the fact that she felt
her senses were leaving her, the thought of Mortimer’s
safety was still uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p>“The signal—the signal,” she moaned hysterically,
“was the signal given in time? Is he safe?
Oh, tell me that he is safe! See—see!”</p>

<p>A shriek broke from her. She sat staring straight
before her as one seized with a paralysis of fear.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley perceived the look; there was no mistaking
its mingled horror and fascinated fear.
Abruptly he turned to ascertain its cause.</p>

<p>There within a few feet of him, with pallid
features so distorted with rage as to be scarcely human,
tall and majestic, the very embodiment of fury,
his eyes ablaze with the sullen fires of vengeance,
stood Captain Stanley Mortimer. A situation releasing
him from his promise—the question of life or
death which alone permitted him to cross the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
threshold of that room—had arisen. He now stood
freed from his pledge.</p>

<p>For a moment the two men faced each other, glaring
into each other’s eyes. Then the torrent of wrath
surging within Mortimer found an outlet in words.</p>

<p>“Scoundrel! Liar!” he hissed between his set
teeth.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Lord Ashley, his anger kindling,
as fire kindles amid straw. “You dare to apply those
epithets to me—the King’s Chancellor!”</p>

<p>“It is as man to man that we now speak,” retorted
Mortimer, struggling with his rage. “Take your
sword and defend your life!” He pointed across
the apartment and through the open doorway of Lord
Ashley’s private bureau. Against the wall, amid a
panoply of arms, could be seen hanging the sword
which the Chancellor had used during the earlier
days of the Russian war.</p>

<p>“I refuse to fight you,” said Lord Ashley. “I
shall summon the guard and have you returned to the
confinement from which you have escaped. Before
you can claim the right to cross swords as an equal,
you must first clear yourself of the stigma of treason
which at present defiles you!”</p>

<p>“You refuse!” retorted Mortimer, with a gesture
of contempt. “Your refusal will avail you
little. I will throttle you to death where you stand.
What!” he continued, with biting sarcasm, “can it
be possible that the uniform of the Guards has at one
time covered the breast of a liar, a traducer and a—<i>coward</i>!”</p>

<p>As this final word left Mortimer’s lips, Lord Ashley’s
face in turn became suffused with rage. With
all the faults, even crimes into which his ambition
had led him in the course of his pyramidal career, one
virtue was yet left him, that of physical courage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
With a snarl of rage, he turned sharply and bounded
across the room to where his sword hung. Back he
ran, drawing the weapon and flinging the scabbard to
one side as he advanced on Mortimer, awaiting him
with drawn blade and the light of battle in his eyes.
Crouched in one corner of the divan, moaning and
hysterical, lay Dorothy.</p>

<p>The swords crossed with a clash. Mortimer was
widely famed in the service for his skill as a swordsman,
but upon this occasion he was fairly matched,
and rarely could there have been seen a finer exhibition
of swordsmanship. There were lightning
feints and thrusts and parries, brilliant grand assaults
and equally brilliant defenses upon either side.
The black eyes of Ashley glared into the blue eyes of
Mortimer, and each pair of eyes flashed forth the
murder which was in the hearts behind them. Backward
and forward they advanced and retreated, feinting
and thrusting, slashing and parrying. At first,
the rage which possessed Mortimer had rendered him
less cool and wary than was to be desired, and so
placed him at a slight disadvantage. Twice Ashley
managed to touch lightly and these wounds, slight as
they were, served as a vent for Mortimer’s overwrought
feelings and lent to him, in some degree, the
necessary coolness and caution. He could feel the
blood trickling down his sleeve, as he skillfully parried
a fierce assault. The tingling of the wounds in
arm and shoulder came pleasurably to his overwrought
spirit. Suddenly he feinted toward the
neck. Up flew Ashley’s weapon in defense. Then,
swift as a shaft of light, Mortimer’s sword-arm shot
out in a straight and deadly thrust. It passed just
under Ashley’s guard, and the point of Mortimer’s
sword went home just below the median line. Such
was the force and fury of the thrust that Mortimer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
blade ran through to the hilt. With an upward fling
of the arms, Ashley crashed backward to the floor, in
a heap.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE LAST STAND OF THE GUARDS</small></h3>
</div>

<p>A murmur—faint at first—gradually swelling
until it merged into a positive cry of alarm! A
strange confusion without the gates, which rapidly
communicated to the grounds within; the sharp blasts
of a bugle; shouts of command; the movements of
men; cries, confusion—then a panic among the guests
and a promiscuous dash to gain the shelter of the
mansion! It all came with the vividness and rapidity
of a thunderbolt!</p>

<p>The garden-party at Fairoaks had promised well
to be spoken of as a red-letter social event. The
guests had been royally amused. The presence
of the King and Queen had lent a special luster to the
occasion and then, too, there was the beautiful Miss
Cameron, affording opportunity alike for observation
and for gossip. The entertainment, under the direction
of Sir Richard Hollowboy, Imperial and Royal
Director of Pyrotechnics and Plastics, had been a
huge success. Sir Richard had more than sustained
his high reputation; upon this occasion he had fairly
eclipsed himself.</p>

<p>Among the features of Sir Richard’s entertainment
were a series of what Sir Richard was pleased to
term, “Fifteen-o’clock Fireworks”—this designation
being presumably intended to create the impression
of fireworks by daylight. The “daylight fireworks,”
as a matter of fact, consisted of certain really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
wonderful smoke effects in the air, representing extremely
interesting and well-executed tableaux.</p>

<p>One of the most colossal reproductions was attracting
the interest of the guests when suddenly something
of a most startling nature occurred. From all
four points of the compass there appeared, as if coming
from the sky itself, a number of strange aërial
forms, which massed themselves about the gigantic
figure in the air and hovered directly above the
grounds of the garden-party. Fantastic forms of
varying sizes were these strange apparitions—forms
which suggested somewhat the outlines of a ship, or
boat; but then—who ever saw a ship, or a boat, floating
in mid-air? Someone whispered that they
formed part of the entertainment; yet there was
something too material, too realistic, about them to
warrant this belief. And were not those human
forms moving about in them?</p>

<p>Outside the gates of Fairoaks, too, strange events
were occurring. The two sentries at the gates, stationed
there because of the presence of their Majesties,
noticed a number of peculiarly constructed mobiles
suddenly make their appearance in the highway.
These mobiles stopped before the grounds of
Fairoaks and the foremost advanced as if to make
its way through the gates. There was something
suspicious about the general appearance and movements
of these mobiles, and one of the sentries
promptly challenged.</p>

<p>His answer was a sudden flash of rifle barrels, a
point-blank volley and, shot through head and breast,
the sentry dropped dead in his tracks. His companion,
apparently unwounded, hastily dodged behind
the high stone wall and, with a ringing shout,
gave the alarm to his fellow-guardsmen, comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
encamped upon one of the wide-stretching lawns a
short distance away.</p>

<p>In an instant, the guards were up and doing.
Through the gateway they swarmed and into the roadway.
They were met by rifle fire from the mobiles,
which, however, immediately beat a hasty retreat.
The guards, several of their number wounded, started
in pursuit, led by Captains Farquharson and Bingham.
The huge aërial shapes which had been hovering
over the grounds, now made movement and rapidly
changed their positions until they floated over the
highway, immediately above the pursuing guards.</p>

<p>Now followed a scene which was as novel in its
form of attack as it was effective and terrible. The
air-ships—for it was now plainly to be seen that air-ships
they were—began raining down missiles, in the
form of exploding bombs, upon the advancing soldiers.
Some of these missiles struck the men direct
and killed them outright, while others fell upon the
hard bed of the highway and exploded, carrying
death and destruction in wide circles.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the highway was filled with
a long track of dead and wounded men, and still the
deadly missiles continued to rain down. Further
pursuit of the mobiles was obviously impossible.
Farquharson and Bingham halted their men. Several
volleys were fired at the air-ships, but this fire
was utterly ineffective. They were either bullet-proof
or out of range.</p>

<p>Unless the officers would see the extermination of
the entire command there in the highway, evidently
the only thing to be done was to find shelter immediately
for the men—the shelter of the mansion. Besides,
in view of this attack, prudence suggested rallying
the guards around the person of the King.</p>

<p>The command was accordingly given to retreat, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
extended order, upon the house. This movement was
only executed with further loss, as the air-ships continued
to follow up and attack. In approaching and
passing through the gateway leading into the grounds,
the men were necessarily more or less massed, and
here the loss was heavy. Captains Farquharson and
Bingham stationed themselves at the approaches to
this gateway, awaiting the passage of the last man,
in order that they themselves might be the last to
pass through. It was here that Captain Farquharson
fell. His brother officer bent over him, in the endeavor
to lend him aid, but one glance was sufficient
to show him that all hope here was past. Then, coolly
as if on parade, he made his way through the grounds
and was the last to enter the house.</p>

<p>His first act was to make provision for defense.
He stationed his men upon the broad main stairway
and also in position to command the windows at the
ground and first stories upon all four sides of the
house. To attempt to station any men upon the roof
was obviously useless, as they would be destroyed
from above by the air-ships, which had been the fate
of the men in the highway. His wounded he disposed
of as best he could, and the royal party and the
guests he gathered together in one group in the big
drawing-rooms on the second floor.</p>

<p>His next thought was of those outside who had
been wounded, and he organized a small corps of men,
under Lieutenant Richmond Dobson, to go out under
a flag of truce and bring them in. This corps started
out, but returned in a very few minutes empty-handed.
Lieutenant Dobson reported that the air-ships
had strictly respected the flag of truce, but at
the gateway he had been met by a similar signal from
the mobiles. The person in command of this party,
who wore a peculiarly-shaped gold star upon his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
shoulder, had informed Lieutenant Dobson that he
could not be permitted to proceed, but that his
wounded would be cared for. The attacking party,
he was informed, had ample surgical assistance with
them for this purpose. The Lieutenant had then
been requested to return to the mansion and bear a
message to the officer in command to the effect that
unless an unconditional surrender was made within
five minutes an attack upon the mansion itself would
be begun.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Captain Bingham fiercely, “it
looks as if they were well-organized and well-prepared,
but we are at least under some shelter here.
Did you inquire in whose name this command was
made?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And what was the answer?”</p>

<p>“That it was made in the name of the General
commanding the First Army Corps of the New Republic.”</p>

<p>“What! A general in command—the First Army
Corps!” muttered Captain Bingham. “That
sounds like a comprehensive organization. It looks
serious!”</p>

<p>At this moment a servant of the house approached
with word that His Majesty wished to see Captain
Bingham and hear his report.</p>

<p>Captain Bingham accordingly went upstairs and
communicated to the King all he had learned.</p>

<p>“Have you audiphoned to the palace for such soldiers
as are there?” inquired His Majesty.</p>

<p>“It would be absolutely useless to do so, Sire,”
replied Captain Bingham. “There is but a comparatively
small force there, and should they attempt to
come to our relief they would be exterminated to a
man before they reached us. Nearly half of my command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
was either killed or wounded in traversing the
short distance from the roadway to the house. What
would it be with any force from the palace attempting
to approach over several miles of ground?”</p>

<p>“True,” said the King. “Where can assistance,
then, be obtained?”</p>

<p>“The nearest point from which effective aid can
be sent,” replied Captain Bingham, “is from the
city, and I have already audiphoned to the army
headquarters there. I have explained the attack,
and stated that we are besieged and have requested
the immediate dispatch of a large force, which has
been promised me. I did this, as it seemed to me to
be the only thing to do, although I frankly confess
that I do not see how even a large force can prevail
against an enemy they cannot reach. Possibly, however,
they may be able to beat off the air-ships with
heavy guns, though I am not sanguine of success.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the King, “it will be some time before
assistance can reach us from the city.”</p>

<p>“Allowing for everything,” replied Captain Bingham,
“about three hours. I have furthermore counseled,
as a measure of precaution, that no attempt
be made to approach here until after nightfall. With
the aid of darkness and a large force, we might at
least hope to get you, Sire, and your suite safely
away.”</p>

<p>“What is it they desire—what is it they ask?”
questioned the King.</p>

<p>“I know no more, Sire, than I have already reported
to you.”</p>

<p>The King reflected a moment.</p>

<p>“Send out to them and inquire,” he commanded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dobson was sent forth once more, accompanied
by a private bearing a flag of truce. He
returned in even less time than before. The answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
he bore was that no further information would be
furnished; no further delay granted. Unless the
King and everyone within the mansion made unconditional
surrender within three minutes after the return
of the flag of truce, an attack would be begun
forthwith.</p>

<p>Captain Bingham reported at once to His Majesty.</p>

<p>“Ah, they appear, then, to know positively that
We are here!” said the King.</p>

<p>“Evidently, Sire,” replied Captain Bingham.</p>

<p>“What remains, then to be done?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Sire,” answered Captain Bingham,
with grim determination, “except for the Guards to
defend this house and those within it while one stone
stands upon another and while there is one man left
upon his feet!”</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a sound of rending, of tearing
and of disrupted masonry on the eastern side of
the mansion.</p>

<p>“The attack has begun, Sire!” said Captain Bingham.
“I would ask your permission to return to my
men.” And with a bow as courtly and as deferential
as if he were standing in the great ball-room of the
palace, Captain Richard Bingham backed from the
royal presence and returned to his men.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached his post at the head of the
main stairway, Captain Bingham quickly perceived
that the attack had been renewed by the air-ships and
that it was directed by hurling explosives against the
eastern wall of the building. So powerful were these
explosives that a great gaping aperture soon appeared,
stretching from window to window, wide and
deep enough to have admitted a motor of the largest
type. The attack was then shifted to the front of
the house and the front wall blown open in a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
manner. Then, with a crash, the whole of the great
front door was blown in.</p>

<p>The soldiers on the ground floor and upon the main
stairway were now exposed to a raking fire from two
sides and the air-ships were not slow to follow up
their advantage. They hurled their explosive missiles
into the men massed upon the stairway and
with rifle fire picked off individual soldiers at windows
and upon the lower floor. The soldiers returned
the fire with spirit, sending volley after volley at the
air-ships as they appeared through the great, yawning
gaps in the walls. This fire seemed, however, utterly
ineffectual against the strong sides of the air-ships
and the protecting shields thrown up around
them. Comrades were falling fast on every side;
the air was filled with the groans and the cries of the
wounded and the dying; the men were growing disheartened.
Then the voice of Captain Bingham rang
out above the tumult:</p>

<p>“Guards, stand fast and die like men!”</p>

<p>A hoarse cheer, despairing yet valiant—the final
testimony to the native valor of the American soldier—came
from the men in response to their leader’s
words. Yes, they would die like men! And carbines
were replenished with fresh determination, and fresh
volleys were poured in upon the enemy.</p>

<p>But it was all of no avail. Their efforts, directed
against an enemy they could not reach, were futile.
Down went Lieutenant Dobson, the last of the sub-alterns
yet unscathed, and still the missiles continued
to rain upon the devoted and rapidly diminishing
band.</p>

<p>The terrible devastation going on was not unknown
to those gathered in the shelter of the drawing-rooms,
and the same servant who had come to him before,
now crept forth to Captain Bingham’s side. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
his hand he carried a large pocket-handkerchief of
white silk, attached to the end of a stick. This he
extended to Captain Bingham.</p>

<p>“His Majesty directs you to surrender,” he stammered,
his teeth chattering with the horror of the
sights about him.</p>

<p>Captain Bingham turned upon him with the blazing
eyes of a madman. “You lie, you scoundrel!”
he shouted. “You have misunderstood His Majesty’s
orders!” And with the flat of his sword he
struck the emblem of surrender from the man’s hand,
and with the point of his sword at the man’s throat
he drove him back to the shelter of the drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>And now the stairway, broken and demolished in
many places, was slippery with blood and choked
with the bodies of the fallen. The rain of missiles
had ceased and had been succeeded by a sharp rifle
fire which rapidly picked off the few remaining survivors.
Down went the color sergeant at Captain
Bingham’s side. The Captain stood at the head of
the stairway, still guarding the approach to the drawing-rooms.
He had been struck on the left side of the
head by a flying fragment of some kind, and from the
wound the blood trickled down his pale face and over
his uniform. He was the last man left.</p>

<p>The rifle fire from the air-ships closed entirely, and
through the demolished front there surged a mass of
men—men from the mobiles. They were armed with
rifles and upon their left shoulders they bore a white
star. A golden star of peculiar formation glittered
upon the shoulder of their leader, and he carried a
sword.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” shouted this leader, advancing up
the stairway, sword in hand, followed by his men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>Captain Bingham, standing grim and bloody at
the head of the stairs, made no reply.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” repeated the leader. “Do you not
see that your men are all dead and that you are
ours?”</p>

<p>“Curse you,” came the reply from the guardsman,
“as they went, so will I go. You shall never pass
while I live.” And with upraised sword he stood
blocking the way to the drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>The leader now crossed swords with Captain Bingham,
while two of his men sought to creep by to
right and left and either attack, or capture, the Captain
from the side. But the officers of the guards
were all brilliant swordsmen, and Captain Bingham
in that last desperate stand fully vindicated the honor
and the reputation of the famous Guards’ corps. Besides,
being at the extreme top of the stairway, he
held an advantage which served to offset the odds
against him. First he wounded the man to the right
and an instant later cut down the man on the left.
Then, with a quick half-arm cut which laid his opponent’s
face open from forehead to chin, he sent the
leader reeling backward down the stairs.</p>

<p>When his men saw their leader fall, a howl of dismay
and rage went up. There was a quick flash of
leveled rifles and a volley. Captain Bingham rose
to his full height and for one brief instant his form
stood erect and rigid. He raised his sword high
aloft and his voice broke into a great hoarse cry—the
last salute of the last of the Guards to the cause
he served:</p>

<p>“Long live the King!”</p>

<p>Then his sword-arm dropped, the weapon fell clattering
from his hand and, with a headlong plunge, he
crashed down the stairs over the dead bodies of his
men.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE NEW ERA</small></h3>
</div>

<p>“The King! The Guards! They have been attacked!”
cried Kearns as, breathless and panting,
he ran into the Chancellerie.</p>

<p>“Attacked!” repeated Mortimer, standing sword
in hand, stern-faced and bleeding from a wound in
the arm. “Attacked by whom?”</p>

<p>“The air-ships—the air-ships!” gasped Kearns.
“But,” he exclaimed, pointing to the form upon the
ground; “what—what is this?”</p>

<p>“One who has met a rightful doom!” answered
Mortimer. “But the attack—tell me of the attack.”</p>

<p>“I was on my way to the King,” said Kearns, in
rapid tones, “and was approaching Fairoaks when I
perceived the air-ships and ordered the phaeromobile
halted. I watched and saw it all.”</p>

<p>“Saw all what?”</p>

<p>“They had driven the King—the guests—the
Guards—all of them into the mansion,” continued
Kearns, with the same rapid enunciation, “and the
air-ships attacked them there. My God! they blew
great holes into the side and front of the house, and
through these holes they made attack upon the
Guards. Then I saw the men in the motors come up
and charge into the mansion and I knew that all
was over. Then, back I came here to you at full
speed, but as I reached the palace I looked behind
and saw that I was being pursued both on land and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
from above. I tell you they are hot upon us—in a
few minutes they will be here!”</p>

<p>The portieres parted as he spoke and Beatrice ran,
eager and excited, into the room.</p>

<p>“We are attacked! A swarm of men are pouring
into the palace and the grounds. Where is Dorothy?
Oh!—oh!—what is this!” and she ran to the figure
lying upon the divan.</p>

<p>“I must go to my post,” cried Mortimer, casting
a desperate glance toward the divan. “I must rally
the men to the defense of the palace!”</p>

<p>“Too late!” exclaimed Kearns, turning sharply.</p>

<p>As he spoke, there were sounds without and
through the portieres and the main door of the Chancellerie
a number of armed men, with stars at their
shoulders, swarmed in, an officer at their head.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” cried the officer, as his eyes fell
upon Mortimer’s uniform.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” repeated Mortimer, with rage.
“How dare you utter that word in the King’s palace
to an officer of the King’s Guard? Back, you horde
of rebels, I say, or I will cut a path through you!”</p>

<p>From behind him there came an exclamation of
fear, a plaintive appeal to him to stop, but he heard
it not and, with upraised sword, he advanced upon
the men barring his passage. The officer raised his
sword in an attitude of defense and a dozen rifles
instantly flashed into position.</p>

<p>“Halt! Do not fire!” came suddenly the sharp
command from the rear and a tall and commanding
figure forced its way through the ranks. An instant
later, Mortimer found himself confronted by General
Mainwarren.</p>

<p>“Do not fire!” repeated General Mainwarren to
his men. “I place this officer and all these here
under my special protection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>“But I cannot—I will not—avail myself of your
protection!” cried Mortimer, still standing with upraised
sword. “I will force my way through to my
men, or fall in the attempt!”</p>

<p>“There will be no necessity for that,” said General
Mainwarren, gently. “Your passage shall not
be barred and you shall be free to go where you
will. But,” he added, calmly, “it will be useless to
seek your soldiers, for they are all dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” repeated Mortimer aghast.</p>

<p>From the grounds without came a great cry:</p>

<p>“Long live the New Republic!”</p>

<p>Before General Mainwarren could make answer to
Mortimer’s exclamation, a file of men, with an officer
in command, invaded the room.</p>

<p>“A wounded guardsman, sir, and his companion,”
reported the officer, saluting General Mainwarren.
“What shall be done with them?” and he brought
forward Captain Swords and Professor Dean.</p>

<p>“Oh, cousin, cousin!” cried Beatrice, running up
to General Mainwarren, all excitement, “I demand
protection—special protection for him!” and she
pointed to Captain Swords.</p>

<p>“It is granted!” said General Mainwarren, with
a smile. “His companion, likewise, shall be protected.
We all of us owe something,” he added,
turning to his men, “to Professor Dean and to Captain
Mortimer.”</p>

<p>“Long live the New Republic!” again came the
cry from the grounds.</p>

<p>“How so? What do you owe us?” exclaimed
Mortimer in astonishment.</p>

<p>“To Professor Dean,” said General Mainwarren,
gravely, “we owe the primary invention of the air-ship
from which we derive our strength; and to Captain
Mortimer, because to his unexpected escape from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
us, the New Republic owes its birth three days earlier
than was anticipated. Yes, Captain Mortimer, your
escape precipitated our attack just three days.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Mortimer, blankly.</p>

<p>“I think you are needed over there,” said Beatrice,
touching him lightly upon the arm, and turning her
eyes toward the divan. “As for me, I must give my
attention to the wounded. How sweet and cute he
looks with the bandage tilted down toward his left
eye!” And she walked to where stood Captain
Swords and rested both hands upon his arm.</p>

<p>Mortimer crossed to the divan where Dorothy lay.
He bent over her until their lips nearly met and
whispered so low that none other heard—something
which brought the color in a warm tide to her pale
face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued General Mainwarren, with fervor,
“we owe, as I have said, something to both of
these men. To-day the New Republic has birth—a
New Republic which shall give men that equality
which can never be found under a monarchy and
which shall be untainted, please God, from the hideous
evils which fastened themselves upon the Old
Republic of our forefathers—a New Republic which
shall free its citizens from the bondage of industrial
slavery and shall set to the world at large an example
of higher economic conditions and a higher standard
of human happiness. Let us joyously greet, then,
this glorious event!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the New Republic!” rang forth
from the men gathered about their General.</p>

<p>From the grounds without came the answering
cry:</p>

<p>“Long live the New Republic! Long live the
New Republic!”</p>
